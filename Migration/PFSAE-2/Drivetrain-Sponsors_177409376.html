I wanted to get in touch with you about getting some parts wire EDM'd for the car. We have the two CV insert parts like we did last year, but also three ~0.5&quot; thick plates of aluminum which need a spline cut out of the center. I am currently working on getting these parts prepared, so I wanted to see when you might be able to fit me in your schedule. I'm aiming to have these ready by the end of the week, so any time after this week would be great.

DONT COPY THESE<ul><li>Our team in the past year has focused on more thorough structrual analysis through hand calculations as well as the ANSYS Static Structural analyses. Specifically, mesh convergence was ensured to be done on every part and a minimum allowable element quality was enforced. More accurate material properties were sourced from MMPDS-11 rather than generic websites which provide an average strength of a material. ANSYS Workbench has been used for analyzing our suspension uprights, wheel hubs, differential mounts, brake rotors, rear sprocket, pedal box frame, undertray, and the rear wing elements. The ANSYS software has allowed us to ensure that the components we design will sustain their expected loads while being able to minimize their weight.</li><li>Our usage of ANSYS software will be similar as the previous year and we will be analyzing the components previously mentioned. We will be iterating through designs to optimize the weight of each of our components while maintaining a minimum safety factor that is appropriate. We will be continuing to improve our methods to become more confident in the simulation results. Our team will continue to use ANSYS for our FEA purposes on structural components.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Arconic - Aluminum sponsor<ul><li>Brian Martin, <a class="external-link" href="mailto:Brian.Martin@arconic.com" rel="nofollow">Brian.Martin@arconic.com</a></li><li>Coordinate with Baja for getting aluminum</li><li>End of the year follow-up<ul><li>In end of the season email, be sure to include photo of the car</li><li>Pictures of machined parts that used their aluminum</li><li>Team photo</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul>
