They were better for keeping track of schedule than all other stuff</li><li>Everyone says this but i still messed it up. More intermediate deadlines, even for good people. If someone thinks it will work first time, they'll put it off. ALWAYS. And people are optimistic about things working the first time.</li><li>Do blockers in TL meetings. People often try to get held up on something out of their control so they can not worry about doing something. These constraints are often not real<ul><li>Try is a strong word, but it has seemed like people are a little too happy to get held up on issues owned by other folks on the team</li></ul></li><li>When someone shows you their work is careless, believe them the first time. Communicate this to team leads often. We waste too much time trying to give projects to people who won't ever be able to good independent work because they treat team projects like class projects - if the analysis runs it's good. It's very different if someone makes honest mistakes, but stuff like not constraining CAD dimensions has pretty consistently been a sign that good work isn't going to happen.</li></ul><h1 id="ChiefHandoff2021&gt;2022-General">General</h1><ul><li>I need to make sure you are a confluence admin</li></ul><p><br/></p><h1 id="ChiefHandoff2021&gt;2022-MERelationship">ME Relationship</h1><ul><li>Things we've gotten in trouble for.

Lead times often surprise people and can push back first run. Making the date end of summer might work.</li><li>Check budget on this after getting an estimate, but it's almost certainly worth making electronics buy all new connectors, sensors, and modules (other than main motec modules)</li></ul><h1 id="ChiefHandoff2021&gt;2022-PF23Design">PF23 Design</h1><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>Need suspension kinematics over the summer. Alec Klaveano is the one who should do this. If these aren't happening, just stick with current kinematics because chassis needs to get started</li><li>Chassis should get started over the summer as well. Set a deadline in summer for when suspension needs to have kinematics locked for chassis, then chassis design and back and forth with suspension will start. This is how the last big kinematics change (2018) happened and it worked pretty well.Â <ul><li>If suspension blows deadline by more than 2 weeks or so, jsut use same kinematics as PF22 and have chassis get started.</li></ul></li><li>Do subteam boundaries again</li><li>Make sure someone owns environments team wide and people know who that is - Frank</li><li>Make sure someone owns structures requirements and people know who that is - Frank / Christian</li><li>Make sure someone owns hardware and mechanical design criteria and people know who that is - JP / Frank / Christian</li><li>I always had to push pretty hard for lap sim usage. To try to keep this alive:<ul><li>Push for it as chief: if you hear any discussion of well it would save some weight but X - that's asking to be lap sim<ul><li>May need to occasionally re-evaluate old decisions with it. Especially if sensitivities change much</li></ul></li><li>Ask Keith (assuming he takes ownership of lap sim successfully) for input with it all the time. He's going to a sophomore and not a team lead, so he may not feel comfortable pushing it on team leads when that's what needs to happen.</li><li>A lot of what the lap sim is good at is blocking dumb design directions. Example: why would we look at monocoque for 8 points when active aero, which is less work and lower risk, is 15 points?</li></ul></li><li>Do a design for serviceability presentation. Main thing is to get rid of excuse that we will need to install anything only once.</li><li>I think initial, PDR, CDR was good. The only problem is that too many CDRs weren't really all the way done, so push the fact that the CDR is must include 100% completed CAD and Analysis. It's gonna be tough if the team is on the schedule where following PF23 design is PF22 testing because that won't force design to be complete for manufacturing.</li></ul><p><br/></p><h1 id="ChiefHandoff2021&gt;2022-Testing">Testing</h1><p><br/></p>
