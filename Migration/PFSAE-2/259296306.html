                    <p><strong>Feedback</strong></p><p><span>Seek feedback and take it seriously</span></p><p><span>It is core competency in engineering to seek feedback. Humans write shitty first drafts of everything and they are really bad at editing their own work. The only way you improve is to get other brains to evaluate your work.<br/>Make a habit of seeking feedback from people you are scared of.</span></p><p><span>It is human nature to want to get positive feedback and find like-minded people to give it to you, but that will rarely if ever make you better. Go find the feedback that makes you uncomfortable and use it to improve the product or your confidence in it.<br/>Getting feedback isn't the end, you need to organize it and work through it to make sure you don't leave easy wins on the table.<br/>You may not integrate every piece of critical feedback you get, but it will make you and your product stronger to know all the criticism none the less.</span></p><p><span>Feedback doesn't mean design by committee. Get your thoughts together, efficiently show them to the person(s) you are looking to get it from, work through it, repeat as necessary &amp; useful.</span></p><p><br/></p><p><strong>Extreme ownership &amp; holding yourself accountable</strong></p><p><span>Ignore the cultish group of people that chant extreme ownership and read books about it . Focus on the core obvious meaning: If we fail, it doesn't matter if you were right, so if something is wrong you should get involved in the solution.</span></p><p><span><br/>Own your product start to finish in all aspects and understand all the systems around you.</span></p><p><span><br/>Assume there's no cavalry for you, but know how to implement them if they do show up.</span></p><p><span>Help people that clearly need it.<br/>Don't mistake extreme ownership for suffering in silence. If you're drowning, request help clearly and help balance impacts. There's no pride in going down with the ship if you decided to try to melt the iceberg with your hands rather than asking the captain to steer around it.</span></p><p><br/></p><p><strong>Safety is everyones responsibility</strong></p><p><span>Human life is more important than big machine. Don't risk your life or someone else's life for a stupid student built racecar. Everyone has the ability to call stop if there's danger.<br/>S</span><span>It may seem to some people as if it would only impact them, but any injury affects everyone from liability to morale.</span></p><p><span>If you get yourself killed, we all still see major consequences. Protect others, protect yourself, protect our common mission.<br/></span></p><p><br/></p><p><strong>Respect your peers (and by peers I mean everyone)</strong></p><p><span>Don't minimize others. We all vent and complain about other people, and that's human, but be very careful of your audience and language. &quot;This person is killing me,&quot; can be perfectly reasonable to confide in a friend in order to make sense of your own thoughts, but don't forget that that person is part of this team, has likely make significant sacrifices and contribution. It is a way better investment to build your relationship and build a better world together with them than to shatter your relationship with a half-baked comment.</span></p><p><span>You will make mistakes. Be prepared to ask for forgiveness and fix relationships with people when you really don't want to. (This is super hard.) It is much easier to re-build a relationship with someone if they know you work hard for your collective goal.<br/>Job descriptions are usually pretty vague, and no one fits the ideals. Understand that a manager or a particular technician or a peer may not fit the exact profile of what you think you need, but I've yet to meet someone around here who wasn't extremely capable in surprising ways.</span></p><p><span>If your lead isn't available when you think they should be doesn't give you the exact guidance you wanted, you can give them that feed back, but then take it on yourself to get over it. Go find some who can help you with what you need (it's a big family here) or figure it out yourself. You'll be better for it. Figure out what the people around you are good at and utilize them and strengthen them around that. I found that some people I worked for weren't great for day to day resources, but I could get incredible feedback from them and flush out certain things. I quickly pivoted to that relationship and found new ways to get the other things I needed. Was it ideal? No, but life rarely is, and it made me more adaptable.</span></p><p><br/></p><p><strong>Respect everyone, but don't put anyone on a pedestal</strong></p><p><span>If you know me and think I'm some kind of hero, stop it. I trained you, because I saw the potential and expect you to exceed me. Steal the qualities you see in me or others that you think are good and try to capture those, but also recognize what I and others do wrong and figure out how to do better there as well.<br/>People around you will be really good at things that you aren't. Recognize that and work in partner with them. Diversity of skill is mega-critical to success, but the ability to recognize where someone else excels is hyper-critical to your collective success.</span></p><p><br/></p><p><strong>Simplify simplify simplify</strong></p><p><span>Get clever and understand your objectives at an essential level. Don't be afraid to iterate and throw away ideas.</span></p><p><span>Ideas are easy, execution is hard. Don't get attached to something because you thought of it. It has to work, and work well.</span></p><p><br/></p><p><strong>Don't jump straight to CAD or complex analysis</strong></p><p><span>Start with a hand sketch and a hand calc. You can convey an incredible amount of information hyper fast with pen and paper.<br/>If you don't know how to draw, grab a pen and start drawing. I guarantee I can get an idea on paper that I can show people faster than you can open NX. Probably faster than you can type in your long-ass password. It doesn't take long to get good at.<br/>If you don't know hand calcs, figure them out. There are lots of resources for this. I absolutely don't want you running an analysis software if you can't get a ±50% estimate with a fast hand calc, and ±20% with a hand calc and some look-up tables. You're dangerous to yourself and others if you rely on complex analysis beyond that.</span></p><p><br/></p><p><strong>Know yourself</strong></p><p><span>Know your limitations when you get tired Know when you're out of your element Try to know what you don't know</span></p><p><br/></p><p><strong>Do the right thing</strong></p><p><span>Be ethical<br/>If you're not sure if you're doing the right thing, ask a third party. 10,000ft of perspective is often useful for these things.<br/>Ends and justifying the means . . . gaining the world and losing your soul . . . more to life than solving problems . . . all that jazz.<br/></span></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p>
