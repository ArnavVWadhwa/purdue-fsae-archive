Yes, no.</span></li></ul><p>Considerations to making MRH wider</p><ul><li>Primarily driver feedback from PF20 considered here <span style="color: rgb(255,0,0);">(so like feedback from comp or testing? - who all gave the feedback and what was it?) Feedback from both.. JP had this feedback to make the main hoop a bit wider.</span></li></ul><p>Iterations on the chassis</p><ul><li>Looked at removing the nonstructural upper SIS tube, decided against it due to gains in LLTD sensitivity <span style="color: rgb(255,0,0);">(what is a big change in LLTD sensitivity? - like were you looking to see what changes wouldn't change LLTD values to x value) </span></li><li>Strict interpretation of 'triangulated node' in context of suspension points led us to choose between removing a lot of tubes or making them 049 <span style="color: rgb(255,0,0);">(explain and give examples - baby tube in front?) There's tubes in PF20 that were 035 / nonstructural. This is documented in PF20 SES.</span></li></ul><h3 id="PF22CHADesignMeeting-LLTDsimset-up">LLTD sim set-up</h3><p>Interested in seeing how chassis stiffness affects suspension set-up changes in terms of understeer and oversteer. Changing the front spring rate alone allows us to look at this. Equally valid would be changing the rear spring rates only. Changing both spring rates wouldn't result in a different vehicle behavior.</p><h3 id="PF22CHADesignMeeting-Additionalslideconsiderations">Additional slide considerations</h3><p>Talk about how we built upon the manufacturing system from PF20 to make tab jigging easier and more accurate e.g. first time comparing CAD with reality <span style="color: rgb(255,0,0);">(how did we compare CAD w/ reality?) Measuring the nodes and comparing with CAD when jigging. I suppose this really only measured tube position not tab position.</span></p><p><br/></p>
