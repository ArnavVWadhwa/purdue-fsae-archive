                    <p>Dyno Tuning Basics</p><p><br/></p><p>General Overview</p><p><br/></p><p>The Dynomite Land &amp; Sea 9” water absorber provides resistance for the engine in order to tune the Efficiency Table, Fuel Maps, and Ignition Maps in Motec M1 Tune.</p><p><br/></p><p>The water absorber is an inefficient water pump that applies a variable load on the engine based on the amount of water that is fed into the water absorber and controlled by the load valve. </p><p><br/></p><p>The throttle position should be held in a fixed position and based on how much the load valve is opened or closed will change the load on the engine and that variable load will change the rpm of the engine. </p><p><br/></p><p>Useful hints for M1 Tune. </p><p>G changes from Graphs to tables </p><p>Q is a magic key and will change the efficiency table to match the Lambda Aim, this also works on paused data and can also be used for other things like the throttle position scaling.</p><p>F1 will show a help screen</p><p>F2 will show a full-time graph</p><p>F6 will make a graph or table full screen</p><p>Spacebar will lock on and give you a target for a tuning cell</p><p><br/></p><p><strong>A quality tune is not possible with an incorrectly calibrated system, make sure that ALL data is as accurate as possible. </strong></p><p><br/></p><p style="">All calibrate, Fuel pressure default under setup type</p><p style="">Fuel pressure gauge absolute or gauge correction?</p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Engine Charge Cooling</strong></p><p>First thing that should be set after correct calibration is the Engine Charge Cooling,</p><p>This value accounts the reduction of temperature that fuel provides in the intake. This is critical for accurate tuning. Without this your efficiency table will not be accurate.</p><p>You will want to have Exhaust Lambda and Fuel Mixture Aim on the same graph line for this process.</p><p><br/></p><ol><li>Bring engine to operating temperature</li><li>Set throttle to 50%, roughly 50 kpa</li><li>Set adjust the load on the engine to roughly 1/3 max rpm, ~4,000-5,000 rpm</li><li>While holding this rpm set the efficiency table, press Q</li><li>Now watch the Graph of Exhaust Lambda and Fuel Mixture Aim</li><li>Richen the Fuel Mixture table cell and surrounding cells on page 3, should be about .7-.8 Lambda<ol><li>If the Exhaust Lambda goes below the Fuel Mixture Aim, reduce the charge temp value by something like 10 C</li><li>If the Exhaust Lambda goes above the Fuel Mixture Aim, raise the charge temp value by something like 10 C</li><li>Repeat step 6 until the Exhaust Lambda and Fuel Mixture Aim follow closely, reducing your changes to Engine Charge Cooling value to a less drastic change each time.</li><li>Repeat steps 6 and 7 with different Lambda values, probably don’t go above a Lambda of 1</li><li>Once you are done make sure to return your Fuel Mixture Aim table back to normal.</li><li>Your Engine Charge Cooling is set. This will make all future changes to tune more predictable and you should not have to change this unless making a physical change to the Engine, Intake or Fuel System.</li></ol></li></ol><p><br/></p><p><strong>Engine Efficiency Table</strong></p><p>The next major step to a proper engine tune is calibrating the Engine Efficiency Table. Remember that an engine is just an air pump, this table is calibrating that air pump.</p><p><br/></p><p>This should be done for as many cells as possible. The table should not have any dramatic peaks or valleys. If your table is not smooth you probably have a calibration issue, go back and check things like your fuel injector linearization tables. If you are in a hurry or are extremely lazy you can smooth out the table using the tools Motec provides.</p><p><br/></p><p>Set throttle at a fixed position, probably 100% first and adjust load on the engine so that you are in a specific cell. Click on a cell and use the SPACEBAR to lock on to a cell, Motec should give you a target. Once in the cell press Q and the Exhaust Lambda should now match the Fuel Mixture Aim, if not just press Q again and if should adjust it the value again and make it more accurate.</p><p>Do this for all cells on the Efficiency Table.</p><p>Once the Efficiency Table is set for That intake, Exhaust, Fuel and Engine Internals set up it should not need to be changed again. Changes to the Fuel Mixture Aim table will not affect this table, while you do probably want a fuel mixture aim table that looks normal when setting the Engine Efficiency Table.</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>Now you probably want to make more power.</p><p>You will do this by going to each cell in the Ignition advance table and add ignition advance until the torque starts to decrease. You will probably have to adjust the load on the engine to hold a constant rpm because changing the Ignition Advance will change how much torque the engine produces.</p><p>You can also change how much power you make by changing the Fuel Mixture Aim.</p><p>Changing your Fuel Mixture Aim will also require you to adjust your ignition advance to make the most efficient power.</p><p><br/></p><p><strong>Tuning Idle!</strong></p><p>Idle mode is <strong>super cool</strong> in how it works and is terrible when it doesn’t.  First thing you should probably check is if you are even in Idle mode, you can set this as a channel a view it while running the engine. While in idle control mode the ECU changes the amount of ignition advance to vary the amount of torque the engine produces and therefore the speed of the engine.</p><p><br/></p><p>So you want to adjust the Idle Control. </p><p>Set up your graph channels to display</p><ol><li><ol><li>Engine Speed</li><li>Idle Aim</li><li><ol><li>Ignition Timing</li><li>Ignition Timing Aim</li></ol></li><li><ol><li>Idle State</li></ol></li><li><ol><li>Throttle Position</li></ol></li></ol></li></ol><p><br/></p><ol><li>Turn off Idle Control, yes do it.</li><li>Now remember how I told you to calibrate every cell on the Engine Efficiency table, yeah you really need to do that for Idle Control to work correctly. You must calibrate the Engine Efficiency table for all rpm speeds above and below the idle aim at low throttle. It may help to add a finer rpm gradient above and below idle rpm. Low rpm is where the engine efficiency really starts change.</li><li>Now you want to add ignition timing in each cell until you can’t gain more speed, you are trying to find the max torque you can produce at these lower rpm cells.  (probably around 13-25° of ignition advance)</li><li>With the engine tuned at these idle rpm’s, we can now turn on idle control mode</li><li>We want to set the Timing Limit Advance Target half way between the max ignition advance (what we found earlier) and min (something around 5°, if this is too low the exhaust temps will get too high)</li><li>Set your Idle Proportional Gain to 250 and try to idle. This should give you something rough, but it will be able to idle, watch the Engine Speed try to match the Idle Aim.</li><li>Lower you Idle Proportional Gain until your Engine Speed smoothly matches your Idle Aim, it will never match perfectly but you want to reduce the big jumps and drops in rpm.</li><li>You will want to finally adjust your throttle idle screw so that your Timing Limit Advance Target and Ignition Timing are close to matching. If your throttle is open too much your Ignition timing will probably be below your Timing Limit Advance.</li></ol><p><br/></p><p>Other things</p><p>Probably want to adjust ignition ramp up to smooth out coming in and out of the throttle (whiskey throttle)</p><p><br/></p><p>Assume fuel pressure does not have an effect on spray pattern and atomization until you can test it, assuming you are within the operating range of the injector</p>
