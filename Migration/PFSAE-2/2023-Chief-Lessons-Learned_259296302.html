I knew this...messed it up, and now i'm telling you.<ul style="list-style-type: square;"><li>we need more intermediate deadlines, even for good people. It will not be done by the deadline. Do not be optimistic. Trust no one. Maybe yourself.<ul style="list-style-type: square;"><li>TL meetings on Mondays make so much more sense.

I know it's tough cause you're personally gonna be stressed and frustrated but at the end of the day you have to realize that you're the one setting the standard and it's all gonna come back to you. </li></ul></li></ul><p><br/></p><p><strong>Lessons Learned</strong></p><ul><li>Design<ul><li>It is very hard to get others to do stuff throughout summer. Try your best to set external goals of what need to be accomplished but an internal set of realistic goals that you're truly trying to get accomplished over summer</li><li>What I personally found very hard was having 30 people do CAD on the car at once. It definitely reduced the work load of each individual contributor but from a Chief stand point it was hard to oversee them all at once</li><li>I was a fan of the CAD clearance checks, some of them might've been too much but there's definitely room for improvement there</li><li>I was also a fan of the overall review structure that we laid out but that definitely could've accelerated as needed. </li><li><strong>Next Year</strong><ul><li>There has been a lot of knowledge that has left the team in this front and it's definitely the one I'd most caution you towards. You need to find a balance between enthusiasm for advancement and risk posture for being able actually finish the car on time. I would heavily monitor progress over summer but truly be realistic of expectations from people. It's so so hard to get people to do work over summer. t</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul>
