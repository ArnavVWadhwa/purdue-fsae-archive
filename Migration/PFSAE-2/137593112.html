                    <h1 id="FailedSponsorships:Acasestudy-ArrowPowderCoating">Arrow Powder Coating</h1><p>Duration of Sponsorship: ?-2018</p><p>Estimated Value: ~$1000</p><p>Reason for termination: &quot;<span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);">I’m going to have to pass as according to your newsletter, it has not been beneficial for either party.&quot;</span></p><p>Who is at fault: The 2017 team, but kinda funky because they sponsored us in 2018, pushed us off in 2019 due to scheduling, and officially terminated in 2020. The ball was also kinda dropped for transition from 2018 to 2019. Sounds like he asked for pictures of the car post season and Logan didn't get him the pictures until 7 months later when he was asking for a confirmation on a time slot for powder coating.</p><p>What can be learned: Anything that could be interpreted as a complaint of quality of work should be avoided in any newsletter or social post.</p><p>Notes: This is slightly strange because they we're sponsors in 2017, a sponsor update letter was sent in the fall and the excuse for not finishing endurance was solenoid wore through the powder coat (could be seen as a complaint of the quality of their work). They powder coated the the 2018 car. <strong>THIS NEEDS MORE DETAIL</strong> They said they could not fit us in their schedule for the 2019 car, ended up paying for someone local to do it. Then when reached out for the 2020 car, referenced the fall 2017 newsletter that the sponsorship was nor beneficial for either party. Upon further inspection we clearly made a mistake with the newsletter, but also it seems like they were looking for a reason to terminate the sponsorship.<br/><strong>Also side note, a picture background with white text for a newsletter is clearly a poor choice.</strong></p><p><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper"><a class="confluence-embedded-file" href="/download/attachments/137593112/PFSAE%20Fall%202017%20Newsletter.pdf?version=1&amp;modificationDate=1577762743000&amp;api=v2" data-nice-type="PDF Document" data-file-src="/download/attachments/137593112/PFSAE%20Fall%202017%20Newsletter.pdf?version=1&amp;modificationDate=1577762743000&amp;api=v2" data-linked-resource-id="137593113" data-linked-resource-type="attachment" data-linked-resource-container-id="137593112" data-linked-resource-default-alias="PFSAE Fall 2017 Newsletter.pdf" data-mime-type="application/pdf" data-has-thumbnail="true" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-can-edit="true" aria-label="PFSAE Fall 2017 Newsletter.pdf" draggable="false"><img src="rest/documentConversion/latest/conversion/thumbnail/137593113/1" height="250" alt="" draggable="false"/></a><span class="companion-edit-button-placeholder edit-button-overlay" data-linked-resource-container-id="137593112" data-linked-resource-id="137593113" data-template-name="companionEditIcon" data-source-location="embedded-attachment"></span></span><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper confluence-embedded-manual-size"><img class="confluence-embedded-image" draggable="false" height="250" src="attachments/137593112/137593114.png" data-image-src="attachments/137593112/137593114.png" data-unresolved-comment-count="0" data-linked-resource-id="137593114" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="attachment" data-linked-resource-default-alias="Screen Shot 2019-12-30 at 9.25.57 PM.png" data-base-url="https://wiki.itap.purdue.edu" data-linked-resource-content-type="image/png" data-linked-resource-container-id="137593112" data-linked-resource-container-version="2" alt=""></span></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p>
