Pretty free form, but it worked really well.</em></p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><em>E: If you don't use first gear, it's a lot easier to remove first, and remove the neutral 'detent'</em>. This would make neutral the size of first plus neutral by reshaping the 'star&quot; gear selector</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Making a custom shift drum seems like a lot of work for something that can be done much simpler, also it sounds like it could be difficult to get the drum to slide smoothly like an oem shift drum.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Making aluminum gear spacers might also be something worth looking into, but lathing down gears could be easier especially with spare gears around.</p>
