These personal objectives might include career advancement, obtaining skills in new technologies, or working with intelligent people on a challenging project. Knowing about each team member’s personal objectives can assist the PM in making mutually beneficial task assignments.</span><br/><span>PMs usually have an inner circle of people, including the people holding the key positions described previously, who are most trusted and most often consulted. While this is natural and necessary, it is important to guard against isolating yourself to the point where you are only hearing what you want to hear. Also, be aware that team member office location can speak volumes in terms of perception.</span><br/><span>It is best for all team members to be colocated in one work area and for all personnel to be dedicated to one project only. Where a full-time discipline is not required, the individual filling the position should be flexible and capable of other duties that comprise a full-time position. If possible, colocate even the part-time team members. This way, their help is more likely to be available when needed. Project team members generally enjoy challenges and don’t mind taking on various or new roles or tasks.</span><br/><span>Key attributes for a PM are:</span><br/><span>* Ability to work with people</span><br/><span>* Leadership ability</span><br/><span>* Ability and desire to listen and understand (and be perceived as one who will listen)</span><br/><span>* Ability to motivate the team</span><br/><span>* Tenacity in the pursuit of project success</span><br/><span>* Previous hands-on management experience with a smaller project or subproject</span><br/><span>* Demonstrated integrity and trust. If either is lost, so is the ability to lead.</span><br/><span>Other rules of thumb for team management are to:</span><br/><span>• Drive as much accountability and responsibility (and provide associated resources) as low in the organization as possible. This trains and motivates team members to take responsibility and solve problems when they can, freeing management to handle issues that can’t be solved by the rest of the team. This is important for several reasons. The PM’s time is limited, and any decisions that can be appropriately delegated should be. Also, those most familiar with</span><br/><span>I never put a person in a job that I felt they were fully qualified to perform, for fear that they would become bored.

Everyone has to feel ownership,</span><br/><span>responsibility, and accountability. The PM needs to find a way to establish this. When successful, the result is that team members and stakeholders rise to the next level in commitment and productivity.</span><br/><span>* Make sure team members get visibility with the highest level of management possible.</span><br/><span>* Foster peer-to-peer verbal communication (versus relying too heavily on e-mail, which is</span><br/><span>often seen as lobbing actions over the fence). Colocation helps.</span><br/><span>* Mentor project team members.</span><br/><span>It is important to recognize when somebody does a good job. This should be done right away. Don’t wait for a special awards day. Reinforcement helps team building—whether it is a pat on the back, a note, handing them a check, or just saying thank you. Personal expressions of appreciation can be more important than more formal and tangible rewards. It is very important to show that kind of positive reinforcement because the team and individuals will build on that positive approach. People need (and value) recognition.</span><br/><span>Likewise, poor performance cannot be ignored. A story from the early days of NASA is an interesting case in point:</span><br/><span>We have a guy in the factory, and he says, “I know I messed up.” He confesses that he made a mistake, recognizing he may be fired. You would like to make a case that this is not acceptable, but do you fire him? That sends a very dangerous message to the other guys. Integrity is not valued. See what I’m saying? You don’t want them to mess up, but you also want them to come forward. You want [them] to be honest. I learned this from von Braun. We had this guy who didn’t hook up some wires like he should have, and he confessed to that. I remember how von Braun bought him a bottle of booze. He did that to reward him for being honest—and he helped him to drink it too! Think about it, do you really want to punish the person for doing the right thing by coming forward? Why dampen his spirit? That makes him less motivated to succeed. We are talking about integrity and honesty.</span><br/><span>– Alex McCool, ASK Magazine</span></p><p>Great point on <span>spending</span> money<br/><span style="color: rgb(84,84,84);">Project management principles are the same on project components as for the total project.
