This makes programming the controls easier and more flexible than trying to use the engine control unit (ECU). The controller incorporates a built in voltage regulator to account for the voltage swing of approximately +10 to +14 V of the car battery. The processor and accompanying board of the controller does not pull more than 350 mA at full load. The solenoid pulls only 380 mA, therefore the system will be under one amp at full load.</p><p>Relays are used to cut the fuel and spark signals. In addition, relays are used to send the signal to the solenoid. The controller uses the signal from the camshaft to get the RPM value. LEDs are used to indicate the current gear selection, and they are powered through the controller.</p><p><a class="external-link" href="http://edge.rit.edu/edge/P05101/public/pics/dash_big.jpg" rel="nofollow"><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper confluence-embedded-manual-size"><img class="confluence-embedded-image confluence-external-resource" draggable="false" height="225" width="300" src="http://edge.rit.edu/edge/P05101/public/pics/dash_small.jpg" data-image-src="http://edge.rit.edu/edge/P05101/public/pics/dash_small.jpg"></span></a></p><p>The controller is programmed to follow the steps of the <a class="external-link" href="http://edge.rit.edu/edge/P05101/public/pics/Jamie_snr_des.jpg" rel="nofollow">flow chart</a>. When the auto up-shift switch is closed and the engine reaches a predetermined RPM value (y), the controller acts to momentarily retard the engine and it also sends a signal to a relay which allows the solenoid to actuate the shift. The RPM value at which the shift will take place is based on the power curve of the engine. The actual value will be determined through testing of the system installed on the car in order to produce the best acceleration performance.</p><p>Momentarily retarding the engine by cutting fuel and spark during a gear shift is referred to as flat shift. This is done using relays that can be turned on or off by the controller. The amount of time the fuel and spark will be cut is determined by the speed of the engine. The higher the speed of the engine, the longer the fuel and spark will have to be cut due to the consistent amount of time it takes to complete a gear shift. Retarding the engine requires the interruption of both fuel and spark due to the problems that might arise if only one is interrupted. If only spark is cut, then unburned fuel will be sent through the exhaust which may cause backfire (ignition of the fuel/air mixture in the exhaust). However, if only fuel is cut, any excess fuel that is left in the combustion chamber may ignite and produce unwanted power.</p><p>After a downshift is called for by the driver, and before the controller sends the signal to the solenoid to actuate a shift, the controller must first perform two checks. The first check is to make sure that the shift drum is not already in neutral (lowest position). If the shift drum is already in neutral then the command will be ignored. (This is also the case for up-shifting when in fifth gear). Next the controller must determine if the downshift will cause the engine RPM to go above it's redline. This is programmed into the controller using information about the gear ratios of the engine. It was determined that it would not be safe to allow a downshift in any gear if the engine RPM is above 9650 in the next higher gear. The command will be ignored if this is the case.</p><p>After a shift has been attempted, it is critical to know whether the gear shift was successful. This is due to the fact that occasionally the gears do not mesh in the transmission and as a result, the shift drum returns to its previous position (to the gear from which is came). This system check is accomplished using a potentiometer attached to the shift drum via a shaft protruding form the side of the engine. If the potentiometer does not register a rotation of the shift drum, then the controller will automatically send the signal to repeat the entire shifting process up to three attempts or until the correct gear is found.</p><p>Another function of the controller is to allow for a rev limit to be set when the launch control feature is activated. This rev limit is set at the RPM value that will produce the best launch of the car when the clutch is released and the engine delivers power to the wheels. The engine RPM is held at the set rev limit using a combination of fuel and spark cut. Similar to the process described for the flat shift feature, the controller will temporarily interrupt the fuel and spark command so that the engine will not be producing power. This will commence at a value just above the desired RPM. When this occurs, the RPM value will begin to drop. Once the engine RPM reaches a value just a little under the desired RPM, the fuel and spark commands are resumed to restore power to the engine and as a result increase the RPM. This process continues until the car is launched.</p></th></tr></tbody></table></div><p align="left"><a class="external-link" href="http://edge.rit.edu/edge/P05101/public/final.htm" rel="nofollow">Back</a></p><p align="left"><br/></p><p align="left"> <a class="external-link" href="http://edge.rit.edu/edge/P05101/public/electrical.htm" rel="nofollow">http://edge.rit.edu/edge/P05101/public/electrical.htm</a></p>
