                    <p>Since 2018 the team has made their own vinyl sponsor stickers for the car. I believe they used to made professionally, but making them ourselves gives us more flexibility and is cheaper. I believe the person who made them before stopped making stickers or something, also if a sticker gets forgotten, like it did in 2017, you have to make them by hand. Having to tools yourself to make stickers is a good option to have.</p><p>In 2018 and 2019 stickers were made with a cricuit cutter. This worked fine once some issues we ironed out. (pressure that the knife needs to cut at and having the correct transfer tape, if it's too strong it makes transferring the stickers very difficult) A limitation of the circuit is you have to use their sticky backplate to cut stickers, this limits the size of your sticker and is a wear item that needs to be replaced. It is also a difficult piece to store, because it should be flat and be kept clean so it stays sticky. Also the vinyl needs to be cut down each time to fit the cutting area.</p><p>Stickers were not needed for 2020 season because of the cancellation of all in person competitions.</p><p><br/></p><p>I think a better tool than the cricuit cutter would be a silhouette cameo 4 plus. I think that the cameo 4 can be used without a mat and has a 15&quot; cutting width, this would match a standard 15&quot; roll of vinyl like the Avery stuff we got sponsored in 2<a class="external-link" href="https://www.silhouetteamerica.com/featured-product/cameo-plus" rel="nofollow">https://www.silhouetteamerica.com/featured-product/cameo-plus</a></p><p><br/></p><p>The cameo 4 was made aware to me by this video, <iframe class="youtube-player" type="text/html" style="width: 400px; height: 300px"

. It's a fun watch and has some good information.</p><p><br/></p><h3 id="MakingStickers-Transfertape:">Transfer tape: </h3><p>this can make or break your sticker making experience, in 2019 different transfer tape was used for a little while and it was an absolute bitch. make note about good transfer tape</p>
