If it's not smooth you are probably having to make corrections which will be slowly and less repeatable</li></ul></li></ul><p>When practicing</p><ul><li>practice like you will play</li><li>I believe autoX has always been clockwise, so setup clockwise autoX's</li><li>another very important skill is being able to walk the course and then putting down your best time in 2 laps, practice this, let others setup the course, walk it, then race it. This is one of the biggest challenges to our competition</li><li>Running shootout style laps back to back is also a very good training tool, once you get to a consistent time, look at the data and find places you can improve.</li></ul><p>Things to nail down before asking for help, roughly 10 hours of seat time</p><ul><li>Need to know to control the car, put it where you want</li><li>Need to know how to car is going to react and how to correct, understeer and oversteer</li><li>Another critical skill is what gear to be in and when, kinda tough to teach, it comes with experience and familiarity with engines (sound and feel are usually the best for this, not a tachometer or shift lights)</li></ul><p>the best drivers can:</p><ul><li>communicate what is happening with the car (they do not need to completely understand how the powertrain or suspension works, or be able to suggest adjustments but they need to be able to communicate what is happening with the car)</li><li>can hit minimal cones (2 secs) and not go off course (20 sec)</li><li>knows when to push the car and when to stop to avoid further mechanical damage (there is rarely and occasion in testing when you should keep driving with a bad sounding car to avoid further damage)</li></ul><p>Things we found in testing PF22</p><ul><li>Smooth driving was faster and more reliable vs quick inputs<ul><li>examples included flicking the car is slaloms was slower and power oversteering after a hairpin was also slower, it was quicker to not break traction on the tires and keep the speed up</li></ul></li></ul><p><br/></p><p>This skip barber video is a fun watch and is a good place to start in terms of going faster</p><ul><li>Skip barber, going faster<ul><li><iframe class="youtube-player" type="text/html" style="width: 400px; height: 300px"
