Our program aims to prepare students for careers in engineering related fields by competing in the Formula SAE competition each year, which involves designing, manufacturing, and competing with an open wheel racecar. This competition requires detailed engineering analysis, precision fabrication of parts, thorough project management, and a solid business foundation to succeed. Our team has members from the colleges of engineering, technology, and management to create a vehicle that can compete at a national level. Each competition is attended by upwards of 100 teams from universities around the country. Our organization has finished in the top 15 teams at our competitions 8 times in our 30 year history, with our best finishes coming this past year during the 2021 season, including a 2nd place finish out of 132 teams worldwide in the design event, and 6th and 9th place finishes at competitions in Michigan and Nevada. The process of building the car allows for our members to apply material learned in class to a real world project, providing tangible skills that can be used in industry during internships and after graduation. Our team has no requirement for major, class standing, or prior experience, and there are no dues associated with our club, meaning any student can join and start learning.</p><p>Our team receives approximately $50,000 in sponsorship each year, with ~$20,000 coming from within Purdue and the remaining $30,000 coming from corporate sponsors. This year, our team is making a major architecture change by switching to a new engine to further improve our competition results, incurring greater costs compared to previous years. As shown in our attached budget, we have a deficit of approximately $20,000. We would like to request $12,000 from the office of the Provost this year if funds are available. We have several leads on additional funding to eliminate our deficit.</p><p>Let me know if you need any other information from us </p><p>Tyler</p>
