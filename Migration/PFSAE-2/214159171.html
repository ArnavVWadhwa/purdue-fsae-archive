Torque specs can be found on the bolted joint margin page, although a separate page in manufacturing might not be a bad idea.</p><p>Also, it's super important to lead the charge on having primary and secondary retention on all threaded fasteners. This often bites us. If a bolt can't be torqued for one reason or another, then the nut being a nylock or jet nut is only one form of retention. Going to a castle nut with locking feature gets back up to two.</p><p>NASA Reference Publication 1228 (Fastener Design Manual) has really good discussion on which forms of secondary retention do and don't work.</p><h1 id="StructuresHandover2022&gt;2023-PF23Design">PF23 Design</h1><h2 id="StructuresHandover2022&gt;2023-Loads">Loads</h2><p>At the start of PF23 design, suspension should set the vehicle speeds and corresponding lateral accelerations in the loads and environments page: <a href="https://wiki.itap.purdue.edu/display/PFSAE/Vehicle+Loads+and+Environments+Master+List" rel="nofollow">Vehicle Loads and Environments Master List - Purdue Formula SAE - Confluence</a>. Chassis and suspension should also agree on loads for driver forces. This can all be driven from vehicle telemetry data. </p><h2 id="StructuresHandover2022&gt;2023-StructuresStandardsandTools">Structures Standards and Tools</h2><p>Table of contents: <a href="https://wiki.itap.purdue.edu/display/PFSAE/Structures+and+Mechanical+Design+Table+of+Contents" rel="nofollow">Structures and Mechanical Design Table of Contents - Purdue Formula SAE - Confluence</a></p><p>Review the links here: <a href="https://wiki.itap.purdue.edu/display/PFSAE/Structures+and+Mechanical+Design+Table+of+Contents" rel="nofollow">Structures and Mechanical Design Table of Contents - Purdue Formula SAE - Confluence</a> as these are all the team structures and mechanical design selection standards that should be kept live if useful. The tools used most that one of the structures heavy team leads should be sure to understand are the bolted joint margin calculator page and the lug margin calculator page. Information on these can be found NASA-STD-5020 and Shigley's Mechanical Engineering Design (Bolts) and Airframe Stress Analysis and Sizing (lugs). Practical Finite Elements is a good book to reference having good mesh quality. It's not specific to any solver such as ANSYS but more of general. The last big item is good knowledge of material properties nuances. Reading the introductory material in MMPDS covers the differences between A-basis, B-basis, S-basis properties; the definitions of all the allowables, and material orientations.</p><p>There are a few standards that could use updated or created:</p><ul><li><a href="https://wiki.itap.purdue.edu/display/PFSAE/Standard+Team+Bolts%2C+Washers%2C+and+Nuts">Standard Team Bolts, Washers, and Nuts</a>:<ul><li>should include guidance on when and how to use anchor nuts here:<ul><li>locations with bad tool axis</li><li>if it carries shear, use floating anchor nut (sometimes called a nutplate) and be sure to size bolt hole correctly to guarantee shear is carried by flange not be the anchor nut<ul><li>(we've had the issue of shear in non-floating anchor nuts going through rivets of the anchor nut, which are not very strong)</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>could do a better job of laying out requirement for two forms of retention and the best and worst types of retention<ul><li>NASA Fastener Design Manual lays out which forms of retention do and do not actuall work: <a class="external-link" href="https://ntrs.nasa.gov/api/citations/19900009424/downloads/19900009424.pdf" rel="nofollow">Fastener Design Manual (nasa.gov)</a></li></ul></li></ul></li><li><a href="https://wiki.itap.purdue.edu/display/PFSAE/Bolt+Margin+Calculator">Bolt Margin Calculator</a>:<ul><li>Include anchor nuts in lookup tables in calculator</li></ul></li><li>New page banning designs:<ul><li>Trying to use bent sheet metal for two-force member tabs has worked about 1/100.

None of them have really been looked over after being made, so finding some errors is likely.</p><p><br/></p><h2 id="StructuresHandover2022&gt;2023-AnalysisIssues">Analysis Issues</h2><h3 id="StructuresHandover2022&gt;2023-Welds">Welds</h3><p>The main analysis type I don't think the team has a good answer for is welds. This includes the weld section in the lug calculator and the welds we analyze with FEA.</p><ul><li>Weld penetration and fitting factor assumptions: the assumed penetration and fitting factor in the lug calculator don't have a good source; Evan and Ben just sorta guessed. It'd be great to find a hand calcs route in a textbook that has reccomendations for factors</li><li>FEA run time and accuracy concerns:<ul><li>Run time: the small welds yield wield, forcing us to use non-linear FEA. This gives a model with a lot of elements because of thin walls. A non-linear model with a lot of elements take forever. You may be able to run linear FEA and use Neuber Stress Correction (<a class="external-link" href="https://www.altair.com/newsroom/articles/neuber-correction-correcting-elastic-stresses-plasticity/" rel="nofollow">Neuber Correction: Correcting Elastic Stresses for Plasticity - Altair Newsroom</a>). If you go this route, be careful to avoid applying the stress correction when a whole section is under load.</li><li>Accuracy: welds are rough not smooth and are a chamfer more than a fillet. The FEA also assumes full penetration, which may not be the case. Non-full penetration in FEA would likely make a singularity. I'm not sure how to fix these concerns but I think some kind of load in the weld pulled from FEA and analyzed with hand calcs is probably the answer.</li></ul></li></ul><p>Next time the team is on a call with Jim Shaw he may be able to help. There DesignJudges website also has place to submit inquiries and one of the editors works in structures at Relativity: <a class="external-link" href="https://www.designjudges.com/contact" rel="nofollow">Contact — DesignJudges.com</a>. Running a few weld sample tests a year could also help develop factors and would certainly be good in the design event.</p><p><br/></p><h3 id="StructuresHandover2022&gt;2023-BoltTorqueandPreload">Bolt Torque and Preload</h3><p>With the recommended torque specs, the calculator will often have a slightly negative tension margin. Part of this comes from not considering running torque, which the recommended values may have been developed to handle. You can usually tweak the preload down a bit to get a positive margin. In design it's worth doing this to make sure the tension load itself isn't too high. However, I wouldn't reccomend actually trying to have different torque specs for bolts that are the same size and type as this would be a pain to track. This is one of the places where the bolt margin calculator is more conservative than we need. If a bolt is torque too high for the application, worst case is it yields under loading and loses a little of its preload. Then you get the most preload you can hold at that joint. The calculations are all linear and don't include this, but bolt materials are selected intentionally for ductility meaning it's likely to occur.</p><p>If you wanted to be really fancy with running torque, you could measure it on a handful of nuts and come up with an average value to assume.</p><p><br/></p><h1 id="StructuresHandover2022&gt;2023-Links">Links</h1><p><a href="https://wiki.itap.purdue.edu/display/PFSAE/Structures+and+Mechanical+Design+Table+of+Contents" rel="nofollow">Structures and Mechanical Design Table of Contents - Purdue Formula SAE - Confluence</a></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p>
