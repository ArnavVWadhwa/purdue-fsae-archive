                    <p>Hello Amanda,</p><p><br/></p><p>We are Purdue Formula SAE, and we are a student racing team; designed, built, and competed 100% by students. We are seeking support for our new car, PF24, and was wondering if <strong>company </strong>would be willing to sponsor us! Product, monetary donations, and services are all welcome!</p><p><br/></p><p>To elaborate, we are essentially a mock mini engineering company. I would like to clarify – we do not get paid for this, and we run 100% off sponsorship donations. We have plenty of recruitment opportunities in various fields of engineering and business<span style="color: rgb(23,43,77);text-decoration: none;"> – many of our members go on to some of the best engineering companies in the world!</span> As far as other benefits to be had from supporting us, we are a 501(c) organization, your logo will be on the car, and much more; all is outlined in the attached sponsorship guide. </p><p><br/></p><p>If you have any questions or would like any clarification, please feel free to reach out!</p>
