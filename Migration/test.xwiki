Read the minimum viable product description __[[here&gt;&gt;Chassis_130162749.html]]__.

We did a good job of meeting the General and Mounting requirements with PF22, but it was more challenging &#x2F; less of a priority with the engine change to determine ergonomics targets. Designing the frame fully remotely, it was difficult to conceptualize how large&#x2F;small everything is.

One project that would be foundational to chassis development would be to make an ergonomics test stand out of 80&#x2F;20 framing extrusion and steel tubing (similar to the dyno, it’s a good entry-level welding project.  also dedicate time in the spring to training welders). This could be used to evaluate different steering wheel positions. This could be a more robust&#x2F;detailed version of the cockpit mock up made __[[here.&gt;&gt;2020-Chassis-Design_132157352.html]]__

This cockpit mock up would be useful in determining the following:

*. Head restraint position e.g. how far behind the head restraint is from the MRH\\
*. Steering wheel angle
*. Steering wheel position
*. Seat belt tabs position e.g. distance from MRH so we don&#x27;t guess the position the night we decide to weld them
*. Shoulder harness bar height
*. Driver back angle
*. Pedalbox Adjustment
*. Steering wheel force input
*. Maximum Main Hoop Width ??? not as relevant
*. 

The results from the cockpit mock up should drive the skeleton reference geometry that the wireframe is built off of.

A rough timeline for next year:

*. Ergo test stand design &amp; fabrication - 4 weeks in Feb&#x2F;Mar
*. Ergo data collection &amp; analysis - 2 weeks in Mar&#x2F;Apr
*. Start working on idea generation with other team leads for PF23 architecture based on PF22 testing &amp; validation
**. Should we stick with the WR450F?
**. Should we raise the BH?
**. Change suspoints to get rid of tubes?
*. Create wireframe - 1 week in late May
*. LLTD &#x2F; Suspoints compliance studies - 3 weeks in June
*. Finalize general tube layout, create tube cross sections and trim bodies according to manufacturing order - 1 week in June&#x2F;July
*. Suspension tabs CAD &amp; lug analysis (can likely assign this to someone)
*. Structures analyses for any points of concern (e.g. engine mounts, steering wheel column)
*. Tube Jig MFG layout
*. Tab Jig MFG layout
*. Break in between internship &amp; school
