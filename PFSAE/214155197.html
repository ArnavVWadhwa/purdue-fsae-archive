                    <p><strong>Events:</strong></p><p>At testing weekend on 4/9 and 4/10. It was noticed that a clicking noise came from the front corner assembly region while manually pushing the car with significant steering angle input (more that 50% to full lock). Initially believed to be hall sensors, so the mounts were bent to increase clearance to trigger wheel and ensure contact was not possible. Noise still persisted. Spent 20-30 minute pushing car in circles and could not determine source. Testing proceeded with skidpad training and noise monitoring between runs.</p><p><br/></p><p>After 1-2 testing runs, a rear clicking was also noticed.</p><p><br/></p><p><strong>Noise character:</strong></p><p>Front clicking:</p><p>With steering at full lock right, clicking was noticeable on front right hub. roughly 4-5 clicks per revolution of the wheel. Clicks always occurred at the same point in rotation. Click sounds like taking handle of small screwdriver and lightly tapping upright assembly. Vibration could be felt equally on all control arm links and tierod.</p><p>Noise does not seem to occur manually rotating wheel with hub lifted.</p><p><br/></p><p>Rear clicking:</p><p>Less frequent (roughly 1 click per revolution) but louder. Very obvious on rear right but could also be occurring on rear left.</p><p><br/></p><p><strong>4/20/2022 Update</strong></p><p>Took car out (no drivetrain installed) and pushed around engineering mall to attempt to recreate clicking. Spent 10-15 minutes pushing around with varying steering input and could only recreate clicking 2-3 times. Note that suspension components were relatively cold (ambient was 40-50F).</p>
