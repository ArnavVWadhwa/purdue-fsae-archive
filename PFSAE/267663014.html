It is something that is on my list of things to look into.</li></ul></li><li>More time discuss that u-joint data: Have some questions<ul style="list-style-type: square;"><li>U-joint play should be under typical loading during driving because I don't care what it will deflect under something the car wont see in reality</li></ul></li><li>Picky thing, table should not say PF23 rack this is not descriptive. What is PF23 rack? Narrco rack right so that should be the name<ul style="list-style-type: square;"><li>Purchase new rack seems like a cop out of looking into and showing other racks on the market along with their specs</li></ul></li><li>I disagree that a custom rack would be more weight, goal of custom would be to take out weight</li><li>I would say design one to similar specs of Narrco and try to remove weight, Narrco is backup<ul style="list-style-type: square;"><li>Would be good for cost event too</li></ul></li><li>Make sure to document all analysis to go through with everyone</li><li>U-Joint Analysis<ul style="list-style-type: square;"><li>Calculator with data to evaluate the 3 driver ergo forces we care about and the play involved</li><li>Try to correlate this</li><li>Reach out to apex for more data at the angle we use </li></ul></li></ul><h3 id="SteeringDCR2FeedbackPF24|Design-Dien&#39;snotes:">Dien's notes:</h3><ul style="list-style-type: square;"><li>What does &quot;max angle misalignment&quot; mean?<ul style="list-style-type: square;"><li>The angle between the input and output sides of a U joint</li></ul></li><li>What are your plans for validating the given data for u-joint play?<ul style="list-style-type: square;"><li>I plan to test the U joints in the past two cars by holding 1 section static and turning the other at a known force and then measuring the resulting play. I will also try to get my hands on an unused U joint if available to test this.</li></ul></li><li>How is using a double u-joint lighter than 2 single u-joint?<ul style="list-style-type: square;"><li>0.24 * 2 vs 1.35?</li><li><a class="confluence-userlink user-mention" data-username="nguye841" href="https://wiki.itap.purdue.edu/display/~nguye841" data-linked-resource-id="230662854" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="userinfo" data-base-url="https://wiki.itap.purdue.edu">Dien Quang Nguyen</a>, I was mentioning if we bought the single u joints offered by other companies, which tend to way around .9lbs</li></ul></li><li>Steering rack comparison should be between specific steering rack (ex: 11.4in narco steering rack vs custom rack vs 14.4in narco rack vs kaz tech rack)</li><li>I think starting from the Narco rack to developing our own steering rack design is worth the time and effort. This ties into our overall team goal as well (continuously challenging ourselves)</li><li>What is the current quick release? <ul style="list-style-type: square;"><li><a class="external-link" href="https://www.subesports.com/lifeline/quick-release-formula-electric/ll-410200001" rel="nofollow">https://www.subesports.com/lifeline/quick-release-formula-electric/ll-410200001</a></li></ul></li><li>Driver visibility ergo study is not really limited by steering, because steering itself it limited by FRH, so if anything that's a frame ergo study </li></ul>
