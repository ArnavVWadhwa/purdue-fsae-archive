                    <p><span>The challenge with post processing has more to do with computational limitations than anything else. The one key issue we’ve been battling with but never actually solved is properly accelerating the post processing process with the </span><span>NVIDIA Tesla GPU nodes on scholar. The GPU nodes straight up just do not seem like </span><span>they are</span><span> helping, even though they should. Post processing is dramatically faster on my desktop than it is on scholar. Solve this bottleneck, and post-processing becoming a whole new </span><span>equation.</span><span> </span><span> </span></p><p><span> </span></p><p><span>Right now, post processing is pretty simple. We export 2D cross sections of scalar fields</span><span>. </span><span>This is something that should continue, and scaling should be standardized.</span></p><p><span> </span></p><p><span>There are a few things to think about when it comes to crosswind situations. </span><span>Namely, what’s your reference velocity? Do you use the magnitude of your incoming wind, or do you use your vehicle velocity? Whatever you pick, make sure it’s consistent. It’s not strange for us to have higher downforce numbers in yaw than </span><span>straight line purely because of how we’re normalizing. </span><span> </span><span> </span></p><p><span> </span></p><p><span>I also think brining back velocity LICs would be very helpful. I’ve heard from Tesla that using LICs can make you lose certain flow features, just by virtue of the math that goes in to generating an LIC, but I’ve found LICs to be a much better way to analyze subtle flow features compared to glyphs. LICs are very graphically heavy to compute, and would realistically require </span><span>GPU acceleration. </span><span> </span></p><p><span> </span></p><p><span>Also, deltas? Do deltas. Right now I (Chenkai) has a image delta tool that is decent, but not great, and no one else uses it. Even then I mainly uses it for alpha blending rather than deltas.</span></p><p><br/></p><p>Switching to using 3rd party post processing tools (e.g. ParaView) would speed up post processing by a lot (almost eliminating the time commitment entirely), but there are two issues. One is getting people onboard, running 3rd party app rendering a 60 mn cell mesh is quite memory intensive, so something like this can't be ran on a potato. The other issue is the file size, file size can easy get up to 30+ GB if you want to export a lot field functions. </p>
