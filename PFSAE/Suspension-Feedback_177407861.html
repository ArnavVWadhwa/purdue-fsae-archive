                    <p>Judge: Keith Wittmer</p><p><br/></p><ul><li>Weight distribution:<ul><li>Picked up on weight distribution sweep having issue of not accounting for adjusting suspension balance based on weight distribution</li><li>Provided recommendation for analyzing:<ul><li>for each weight distribution adjust suspension rates to maintain the same oversteer / understeer balance. Metric could be front to rear slip angle ratio or steering input. (Keith didn't mention understeer gradient specifically, but that's a thought i had from this)</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>For simple events in lap sim, should use a transient sim to compare. This is only really for accel. Run a transient accel event and see if it's much off of lap time output. The higher fidelity model may have important behaviors being missed.</li><li>Tires:<ul><li>I forgot to mention camber sensitivity and got called out for that</li><li>Should discuss pressure sensitivity</li><li>Should be careful to not show beyond the data in model because it looks wrong</li></ul></li><li>Rates:<ul><li>recommended to make it clearer that we have adjustability, should discuss how much adjustability we use</li><li>Improve discussion and thinking of design for aero. Need to be clear it's more than not hitting it into the ground. (should give a value on FW height that cause big loss. should say we aren't very roll sensitive)</li><li>In general, keith made point that a motorsports background judge is going to be very up for hearing suspension design to support aero</li><li>Discussion of fact that higher spring rates harms adjustability (tire rates drive)</li></ul></li><li>Keeping rates down while accomodating aero:<ul><li>Anti dive:<br/><ul><li>Discussion led to fact that we should probably use anti-dive. It's hard to decide the most we could get away with. It drives higher suspension loads and maybe makes packaging hard, but couldnt come up with a limit outside of this. But some arbitrary amount that's clearly not going to nuke anything, like 15%, probably makes sense.</li></ul></li><li>Bump stops:<ul><li>If you have one event that really drives needing bigger springs, could engineer bumpstops to handle that event so that you can run softer springs for other maneuvers (and still not hit the bumpstop)</li><li>IE, bumpstop for braking case that doesnt get used in any other case</li></ul></li><li>Progressive rates: agreed these are bad because of balance harm corner entry</li></ul></li><li>Discuss our tuning program:<ul><li>Need to take credit for what we dide - run skidpad, set ARBs. Run big skidpad, set aero.</li><li>HOPEFULLY more lap sim correllation</li></ul></li><li>Sim software:<ul><li>was surprised we use adams because of how much a pain it is. Mentioned dymola and car sim. (Several judges have pointed out car sim as being more intuitive at this point)</li><li>Encouraged all steps to pass along lap sim tool</li></ul></li></ul>
