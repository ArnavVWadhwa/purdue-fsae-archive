                    <div class="table-wrap"><table class="confluenceTable"><colgroup><col style="width: 189.0px;"/><col style="width: 1633.0px;"/></colgroup><tbody><tr><th class="confluenceTh"><strong>Word</strong></th><th class="confluenceTh"><strong>Definition</strong></th></tr><tr><td class="confluenceTd">Prepreg</td><td class="confluenceTd">Prepreg is short for Pre-impregnated. If a carbon is designated as prepreg, it means that resin has been applied to the carbon before hand.</td></tr><tr><td class="confluenceTd"><p>Layup Schedule</p></td><td class="confluenceTd">A layup schedule is a written plan regarding the number of plies, the order of each ply, and the orientation of each ply in your laminate.</td></tr><tr><td class="confluenceTd">Film Adhesive</td><td class="confluenceTd">Film adhesive is a material generally made from a very thin layer of fiberglass with a high resin content. It acts as glue that bonds the carbon laminates to the core material.</td></tr><tr><td class="confluenceTd">Core Material</td><td class="confluenceTd">The Core material is what is placed in between the two carbon laminates to make up your sandwich panel. In composite, the core material is generally a honeycomb type of structure. It acts as a reinforcement for your panel as it increases the stiffness.</td></tr><tr><td class="confluenceTd">Freekote</td><td class="confluenceTd">Freekote is a liquid product that should be applied on the mold you are using for your layup prior to performing your layup. Its main purpose is to prevent your part from staying stuck on your mold after the curing process is over.</td></tr><tr><td class="confluenceTd">Acetone</td><td class="confluenceTd">Acetone is used to clean the surfaces of the molds.</td></tr><tr><td class="confluenceTd">Vacuum bag</td><td class="confluenceTd">A Vacuum bag is a transparent plastic bag used to subject your layup and mold to a vacuum.</td></tr><tr><td class="confluenceTd">Vacuum tape</td><td class="confluenceTd">Vacuum tape is similar to &quot;blue tack&quot;. It is stuck onto the whole outer edge of your mold and is used to be able to seal the vacuum bag without letting any air getting into the bag.</td></tr><tr><td class="confluenceTd">Breather</td><td class="confluenceTd">The breather material is similar to wool. It is placed inside the vacuum bag to help the valve suck the air out of the vacuum bag for a quasi-perfect vacuum.</td></tr><tr><td class="confluenceTd">Peel Ply</td><td class="confluenceTd">The peel ply material is placed directly on top of the carbon during the layup schedule. It is used to seperate the carbon from the vacuum bag and breather because once the cure cycle is over, it should be possible to peel the material off the cured part.</td></tr><tr><td class="confluenceTd">Debulking</td><td class="confluenceTd">Debulking refers to compressing your composite part in a vacuum such that there is no air present in between layers or carbon. Debulking is very important to obtain a good composite part and it should always be done for 10 to 15 minutes after the layup process.</td></tr><tr><td class="confluenceTd">Laminate</td><td class="confluenceTd">A laminate is a stack up of multiple layers of carbon on top of each other.</td></tr><tr><td class="confluenceTd">Sandwich Panel</td><td class="confluenceTd">A sandwich panel includes two laminates and a core material in between each laminate.</td></tr><tr><td class="confluenceTd">Delamination</td><td class="confluenceTd">Delamination is a phenomenon that occurs once your sandwich panel undergoes failure due to an applied load. During that failure, the top or bottom laminate of your panel disconnects from the core material. It is recommended to avoid delamination.</td></tr><tr><td class="confluenceTd">Ply Failure</td><td class="confluenceTd">Ply failure is a phenomenon that occurs once your sandwich panel undergoes failure due to an applied load. During that failure, the fibers in the laminates of your panel should individually crack until the panel fails. It is recommended to design panels for ply failure.</td></tr><tr><td class="confluenceTd">Unidirectional Carbon</td><td class="confluenceTd">Unidirectional carbon is a material where all the carbon filaments are assembled such that they move along one direction. Unidirectional carbon is very strong along the direction of the fibers, but very weak along the width of the fibers.</td></tr><tr><td class="confluenceTd">Woven Carbon</td><td class="confluenceTd">Woven carbon is a material where the carbon filaments are assembled such that they move along a horizontal and vertical axis. The filaments are essentially perpindicular to each other. Woven carbon is equally strong in in all directions.</td></tr><tr><td class="confluenceTd">Interlaminar Shear Strength</td><td class="confluenceTd">The interlaminar shear strength represents the stress that the carbon needs to experience along the height of a laminate such that each ply disconnects from the laminate.</td></tr><tr><td class="confluenceTd"><p>Insert</p></td><td class="confluenceTd">An insert is used to reinforce sections of your sandwich panel in which tabs are placed. The insert's primary function is to carry the load from the tab throughout the sandwich panel without failure ocurring.</td></tr></tbody></table></div>
