This only works when the springs are torsion springs, and are mounted in front of the throttle pedal (in terms of driving direction). The calculator also outputs other plots which can be relevant for design, which will be discussed in the &quot;outputs&quot; section.</p><h1 id="ForemountedSpringForceCalculator-UsageInstructions">Usage Instructions</h1><ol><li>Download the matlab file</li><li>Press run</li><li>When prompted by a popup window, input pedal parameters. The autofilled defaults are what PF24 used.</li><li>When prompted by a popup window, input spring parameters. The autofilled defaults are what PF24 used.</li><li>Observe the output graphs<ol><li>If you don't want a ccertain plot to be made, comment out the section at the bottom for that plot. Many of the plots are just used for diagnostics so you don't need those</li><li>The spring is mounted centered at (0,0), and the points on the graph correspond to places where the pivot point of the throttle pedal could be.</li><li>To see the 3d surface for each plot (eyecandy), rotate the plot. They start facing down because that is the most useful view.</li></ol></li></ol><h1 id="ForemountedSpringForceCalculator-Whatcalculationistheprogramactuallydoing?">What calculation is the program actually doing?</h1><p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);">Visualisation Desmos: <a class="external-link" href="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/kjsfd5cayd" rel="nofollow" style="color: rgb(0,0,0);">https://www.desmos.com/calculator/kjsfd5cayd</a></span></p><p><span><span style="color: rgb(0,128,19);"><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);">I made this desmos page that lets you visualize the spring position relative to the throttle pedal. The origin is the center of the spring. The small circle is the outer diameter of the body of the spring. The large circle is the reach of the leg of the spring. The two diagonal lines that intersect at (dx,dy) represent the initial and final throttle pedal positions. The lines that are tangent to the small circle, and intersect the large circle at the same point as one of the throttle pedal positions are the spring leg position lines.</span></span></span></p><p><span><span style="color: rgb(0,128,19);"><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);">Below, two screenshots of the desmos are shown.

If the leg of the spring bends instead of the coils, this takes away some of the angular travel, decreasing spring force the pedal actually feels.</li><li>This assumption is likely very minor because we are mostly considering springs with short legs(For design reasons), which won't have very much bending over their lengths. </li><li>The assumption could be remedied with a bending calculation, but assuming a bent leg would significantly complicate all calculations.</li></ol></li><li>The leg stays tangent to the body<ol><li>I am not 100% certain that the leg stays tangent to the spring as it coils around it. It might cut across the face of the spring when coiled</li><li>If this occurs it will decrease actual travel angle, decreasing the true spring force, making the calculator optimistic</li><li>I believe that if this happens, it does so very little but I can not find any evidence for or against that claim</li></ol></li><li>Friction between the spring and pedal is not considered<ol><li>The spring is sliding, and it is being held quite firmly to the pedal, this means there is friction at the contact</li><li>Not considering this friction is conservative, because the friction impedes movement, and thus makes the pedal stiffer WHEN MOVED only.</li></ol></li></ol><h1 id="ForemountedSpringForceCalculator-Weaknesses">Weaknesses</h1><ol><li>The spring must contact a point along the pedal's axis, so the pedal cannot have a thickness<ol><li>I know how to fix this, it would probably take me a few hours. I do not have the time. Perhaps a giga goon in the future can make this happen?</li></ol></li><li>The relationship between position and weight is not explored<ol><li>The position of the spring matters because of the return force it generates, and the weight of the assembly. The simulation only concerns itself with return force.</li><li>This could be added but it would take an hour or 2 and be handwavy at best</li></ol></li><li>User has to go in and comment out plots they do not want to see<ol><li>I think this is easier than having to pick every time you run the sim</li></ol></li></ol>
