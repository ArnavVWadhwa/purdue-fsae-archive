My name is Helen Rumsey and I'm a chassis member on Purdue Formula SAE. We're a student organization at Purdue who builds an open-wheel style race car every year and competes in the Formula SAE competition. We typically get our frame and suspension control arms powder coated and are looking for a company to help us. As a student organization, we're funded through the generosity of sponsors so any sponsorship or discounted would be greatly appreciated. Is that something that Creative Finishing would be interested in? </p><p><br/></p><p><strong>Background: </strong>Ria emailing Alana at EnginSoft</p><p>Hi Alana,</p><p>My name is<span> </span><span class="mark9nvsmi084" style="color: inherit;">Ria</span><span> </span>Singhal, and I am a member of Purdue Formula SAE (FSAE). FSAE is a design competition where students are annually challenged to design and manufacture a small open-wheel car.  Recently, a few representatives from our team met with EnginSoft at SAE International COMVEC, and we would be immensely grateful for your support regarding our steering rack design. For the 2023-24 season, we are designing a custom steering rack for the first time. While we have made progress with the CAD design of the rack and pinion gear interface, we see vast potential in utilizing the advanced gear modeling and simulation tools in the GearKS Toolkit within the RecurDyn/DriveTrain software.</p><p>We are excited to explore the possibility of collaborating with EnginSoft and would be incredibly appreciative if we could arrange a brief meeting sometime soon to discuss the potential partnership further. Your support would genuinely be invaluable to our team's success. </p><p>Finally, I have attached our team's sponsorship guide. All sponsorship values are not limited to cash, and we would appreciate any resources or guidance you can provide. </p><p>Thank you,<br/><span class="mark9nvsmi084" style="color: inherit;">Ria</span><span> </span>Singhal<br/>Purdue Formula SAE</p><p><br/></p><p><strong>Background: </strong>Helen reaching out to Pure Blue USA about high temp lines for pneumatics. I sent this email and didn't get a response. I called a week later and they were super helpful and told me to email again and then sent us the tubing for free/ we only paid for shipping. </p><p>Hello,</p><p>My name is Helen Rumsey and I'm a member of Purdue Formula SAE. We compete in the Collegiate SAE International Competition with an internal combustion, Formula 1 style car every year. Our team uses a pneumatic system for shifting and were looking at your website for tubing (specifically the 1/4 inch OD. x 1/8 inch ID. PTFE Teflon Tubing Natural Virgin Extreme - Temperature). We would only need a couple of feet and were wondering if you have any extra you could send us at no cost. Our team relies on the generous support of sponsors to compete each year and would really appreciate your help.</p><p>I've attached our sponsor guide, which has some images of our car, and included a link to our website below. Please reach out if you're able to help or have additional questions about our team.</p><p>Thanks,</p><p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);"><strong>Helen Rumsey</strong></span><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);"> </span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);"><u><a class="external-link" href="https://engineering.purdue.edu/fsae/wordpress/" rel="nofollow" title="https://engineering.purdue.edu/fsae/wordpress/">Purdue Formula SAE</a></u><span> </span>President 2023-2024</span><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);"> </span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);"><a class="external-link" href="mailto:hrumsey@purdue.edu" rel="nofollow">hrumsey@purdue.edu</a> | (812) 344-3743</span></p><p><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper"><img class="confluence-embedded-image" draggable="false" src="attachments/273157600/273157620.png" data-image-src="attachments/273157600/273157620.png" data-unresolved-comment-count="0" data-linked-resource-id="273157620" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="attachment" data-linked-resource-default-alias="image-2023-10-3_20-15-3.png" data-base-url="https://wiki.itap.purdue.edu" data-linked-resource-content-type="image/png" data-linked-resource-container-id="273157600" data-linked-resource-container-version="3" alt=""></span></p><p><br/></p>
