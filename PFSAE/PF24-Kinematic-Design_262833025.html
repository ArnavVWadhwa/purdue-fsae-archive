As of recent years 0% Anti's have been ran. The reasoning that I am aware of is the complexity they can add and it seems easier to say you can't do harm without them and that the jacking forces coupled with increased loading in suspension arms is enough to ignore them. I believe this is not the right way to look at it. Many top teams seem to run Anti's especially the faster cars. Stuttgart runs quite a bit of anti-dive so there is definitely something there that we need to consider.Â </li><li>What I know regarding Anti-dive<ul><li>Same Load Transfer just different amount through elastic vs geometric</li><li>Geometric load transfer increases suspension arm loading</li><li>Decreases the amount the front suspension travels for the same decceleration effectively stiffening the axle while pitching</li><li>The side view IC does dictate the pitch center along with caster variation in heave. Too much caster variation can lead to heavier steering especially on corner entry. This variation also means the wheelbase can have variation similar to how track width varies. There might be some stability gained with having caster vary by some amount but I am not sure</li><li>Jacking forces are introduced and can lead to potential instability</li><li>Handling with anti's needs to be considered</li></ul></li><li>What I have questions on<ul><li>What do we want with caster variation</li><li>How much jacking force becomes a problem</li><li>Where and why should pitch centers be located (my thought is this can change driver feeling under braking )</li><li>How much anti-dive variation is there with travel</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Iteration 2: 6/11/2023<ul><li>Decided that anti-geometries are not worth the time necessary, it is possible to run small amounts ~20-30% and be okay but to remain on the safe side without justification, planning to run none<ul><li>Anti-dive of 30% changes pitch gradient my 0.06 deg/G which seems minimal but equates to a 0.2 in change in front wing height under same braking condition</li></ul></li><li>Moving forward with design, and kinematics<ul><li>Want to study RCH variation and minimize it</li><li>Want to improve camber gain</li><li>Would be nice to have in-depth analysis on suspension frequency and damping selection</li></ul></li><li>Determined LLTD adjustability with ARB from 45% to 54%<ul><li>Should be achieved using 25 lbf/in Wheel Rate Addition for each adjustment</li><li>Baseline Setup would be 50lbf/in front and rear with the ability to add up to 150 lbf/in on each axle.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><p><br/></p>
