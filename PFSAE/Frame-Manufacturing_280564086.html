                    <p>This is current as of December 2023. </p><h2 id="FrameManufacturing-Manufacturingaspaceframe">Manufacturing a spaceframe</h2><p>To my knowledge, the team has only ever built spaceframes. Hence, this page provides an overview of the manufacturing process for a spaceframe. Aside from designs utilizing bolted joints between tubes of different materials, most spaceframes tend to be made completely out a single material (all tubes are most likely steel). This enables the welding of steel tubes together to create a frame. </p><p>Frame manufacturing process:</p><ol><li>Tube preparation</li><li>Jigging</li><li>Welding</li><li>Heat treat</li><li>Powdercoat</li></ol><p>Strictly speaking, powder-coating and heat treating aren't required to manufacture a frame, but are included as performance-enhancing features. </p><h2 id="FrameManufacturing-TubePreparation">Tube Preparation</h2><p>Common processes included in tube preparation phase:</p><ul style="list-style-type: square;"><li>Bending</li><li>Coping/Notching</li><li>Cleaning</li></ul><h3 id="FrameManufacturing-TubeBending">Tube Bending</h3><p>As the name suggests, this involves bending (usually round) tubes to a desired angle. Tubes in the chassis that might require bending are the roll hoops, headrest mount, and perhaps front bulkhead supports/main hoop brace supports. More information on tube bending is available in <strong>this page</strong>.</p><h3 id="FrameManufacturing-TubeCoping/Notching">Tube Coping/Notching</h3><p>Tube coping or also called notching is the process of cutting a tube at an angle. The goal of this is to make tubes join more easily, resulting in better joints. The better the tube cope, the easier and more efficient it will be to weld.</p><h3 id="FrameManufacturing-Tubecleaning">Tube cleaning</h3><p>This is self-explanatory but sometimes not emphasized enough, or not executed properly. When two tubes are welded together at a joint, the material at the joint zone is heated to a molten form. This means any foreign particles (on the outer or inner surface) of the tube is drawn into the &quot;weld pool&quot;, and the existence of foreign particles contaminates the weld, leading to porosity and a weaker joint. In this case, &quot;foreign particles&quot; could be anything from oxidized metal coating on the tube due to prolonged exposure to humidity, air, metal particles from grinding, dust particles, etc. It is arguably the most important thing to ensure that any welded tube is &quot;prepped&quot; (cleaned) as thoroughly as possible.  </p><p><br/></p><h2 id="FrameManufacturing-Jigging">Jigging</h2><p>A &quot;jig&quot; is defined as a device or fixture designed to secure an object in place. Commonly, welded components are accompanied by welding jigs to ensure parts do not deflect significantly due to thermal effects and that they are in the right place when being welded. In this context, the &quot;right place&quot; often means correct relative to each other, or to a single datum. </p><p>Similarly, the frame - which typically consists of 50+ tubes - needs a jig to ensure tubes and mounting locations are in the correct place when welded. There are multiple ways to achieve this, the most common of which is to use large MDF boards that constrain the cross-sectional location of multiple tubes in the frame at once, then stacking MDF boards on top of each other, The picture below should illustrate this better than any of my words can. </p><p><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper"><img class="confluence-embedded-image confluence-external-resource" draggable="false" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EUS89iCUYAAhhvA.jpg" data-image-src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EUS89iCUYAAhhvA.jpg"></span> </p><p><br/></p><p>Our team has been using a metal jig system, split up in 3-5 stages that progresses along with the welding of the frame. </p><h2 id="FrameManufacturing-Welding">Welding</h2><p>Once the frame is jigged, tubes will be welded together at joints. As most chassis tubes have a small OD (1in) and the chassis will undergo significant loads from suspension, precision, and strength of welds are two important factors. Therefore, we TIG weld the frame instead of alternatives such as MIG or stick welding.</p><h3 id="FrameManufacturing-Resources:">Resources:</h3><p>Pages and websites listed below are very good sources of information on processes in frame manufacturing.</p><ul style="list-style-type: square;"><li>Tube bending: <a class="external-link" href="https://www.roguefab.com/what-is-tube-bending/" rel="nofollow">https://www.roguefab.com/what-is-tube-bending/</a></li><li>Tube notching:</li><li style="font-weight: bold;"><u><strong><a href="PF22-Frame-Welding_192190081.html">PF22 Frame Welding</a></strong></u></li></ul>
