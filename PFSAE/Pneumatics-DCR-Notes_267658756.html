I know we could also upgrade the battery, so that's something to consider, but yeah just a thought I had</li><li>do we just want a clutch cylinder so that we can clutch and downshift? if we can get rid of that, then we should be able to go just manual which would be great</li><li>I don't think we need the contigency plan if we have spares for pneumatics. I would rather pour more engineering resources to a better and more refined pneumatics / electronic package than waste time building a manual system. </li><li>side note: eating peanut butter rn</li><li>i mean i agree i dont see a reason to really change actual pneumatics components, but lets just keep an open mind and be open to an architecture change if we really think that it gives us a performance benefit</li></ul><p><br/></p><h3 id="PneumaticsDCRNotes-ActionItems:">Action Items:</h3><ul class="inline-task-list" data-inline-tasks-content-id="267658756"><li class="checked" data-inline-task-id="3">Identify and analyze potential areas of improvement for pneumatic shifter <time datetime="2023-08-09" class="date-past">09 Aug 2023</time> <a class="confluence-userlink user-mention" data-username="hrumsey" href="https://wiki.itap.purdue.edu/display/~hrumsey" data-linked-resource-id="143757320" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="userinfo" data-base-url="https://wiki.itap.purdue.edu">Rumsey, Helen Nicole</a> <a class="confluence-userlink user-mention" data-username="kalbanes" href="https://wiki.itap.purdue.edu/display/~kalbanes" data-linked-resource-id="230659762" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="userinfo" data-base-url="https://wiki.itap.purdue.edu">Albanese, Katherine</a> </li><li class="checked" data-inline-task-id="4">Trade study of additional manual clutch vs continuing pneumatic clutch <time datetime="2023-08-09" class="date-past">09 Aug 2023</time> <a class="confluence-userlink user-mention" data-username="hrumsey" href="https://wiki.itap.purdue.edu/display/~hrumsey" data-linked-resource-id="143757320" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="userinfo" data-base-url="https://wiki.itap.purdue.edu">Rumsey, Helen Nicole</a> <a class="confluence-userlink user-mention" data-username="kalbanes" href="https://wiki.itap.purdue.edu/display/~kalbanes" data-linked-resource-id="230659762" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="userinfo" data-base-url="https://wiki.itap.purdue.edu">Albanese, Katherine</a> </li></ul><p><br/></p><p><strong>DCRv2</strong></p><p><strong>Hunter's Feedback:</strong></p><ul><li>Doing solenoid for clutch control?<br/><ul><li>Lacking analog voltage inputs for slow clutch paddle → Buttons preferred otherwise very dependent on Matt's CAN expander</li><li>Also lacking outputs for electronically adjustable valve → Same dependence on CAN expander</li></ul></li><li>24V not easy would prefer 12V unless 24V is actually better</li></ul><p><br/></p><p><strong>Keith's Feedback:</strong></p><ul><li>Very nice diagram</li><li>How is sizing for Air tank determined this year (since we had issues with this last year)</li><li>Reach out to Empire for more specs such as weight</li><li>Any thoughts on addressing the delay with the air being sent from the solenoid to fill lines before pistons?
