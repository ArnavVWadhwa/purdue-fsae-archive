                    <p>Now that we have seen different kinds of forces, axial and shear, we need to discuss moments. If you are already familiar and comfortable with concept of moments, you can skip the first sub-section of this page and move directly to Shear Force and Bending Moment Diagrams.</p><h2 id="id-5.ShearForceandBendingMomentDiagrams-Moments">Moments</h2><p><span style="color: rgb(17,17,17);">The </span><strong>Moment</strong><span style="color: rgb(17,17,17);"> of a force is a measure of its tendency to cause a body to rotate about a specific point or axis. This is different from the tendency for a body to move, or translate, in the direction of the force. In order for a moment to develop, the force must act upon the body in such a manner that the body would begin to twist. This occurs every time a force is applied that does not pass through the centroid of the body. A moment is due to a force not having an equal and opposite force directly along it's line of action. [12]</span></p><p>Imagine you are trying to push open a door. Most people normally push on the door farther away from its hinge. Have you thought about why? Have you ever tried to push open a door from the middle of the door? or right next to the hinge? It's much harder. That's because, when you are farther away from the pivot (door hinge), you are creating a larger moment, or torque, which makes swinging the door open easier. This idea of a lever arm is key to understanding moment. [3]</p><p>The higher the moment about a reference point is, the more force is being exerted on that point. It is also important to note that moments can be positive or negative. The sign convention is counter-clockwise is considered positive and clockwise is considered negative. This follows the right-hand rule. [3]</p><h2 id="id-5.ShearForceandBendingMomentDiagrams-BendingMoments">Bending Moments</h2><p>A bending moment looks specifically at the reaction from an applied moment. In a beam, or object with thickness, a bending moment cause axial forces in both tension and compression as shown below. The bottom half of the beam is in tension because as it bends, it stretches this material. The top half of the beam is in compression because as it bends, it is compressed. The center line of the beam is not in tension or compression; there are no axial forces at that point.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper image-center-wrapper confluence-embedded-manual-size"><img class="confluence-embedded-image image-center" draggable="false" height="150" src="attachments/146768339/146768349.png" data-image-src="attachments/146768339/146768349.png" data-unresolved-comment-count="0" data-linked-resource-id="146768349" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="attachment" data-linked-resource-default-alias="image2020-4-28_15-46-1.png" data-base-url="https://wiki.itap.purdue.edu" data-linked-resource-content-type="image/png" data-linked-resource-container-id="146768339" data-linked-resource-container-version="5" alt=""></span>[3]</p><p>The image below show the beam from above bus without showing its deformation. It does more clearly show the internal forces acting on a cut at the center of the beam. Notice how, at the neutral axis, the magnitude of the internal force is zero.</p><p><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper image-center-wrapper"><img class="confluence-embedded-image confluence-external-resource image-center" draggable="false" src="https://www.bu.edu/moss/files/2015/03/bending_linearstress.jpg" data-image-src="https://www.bu.edu/moss/files/2015/03/bending_linearstress.jpg"></span></p><p style="text-align: center;">[15]</p><h2 id="id-5.ShearForceandBendingMomentDiagrams-ShearForceandBendingMomentDiagrams">Shear Force and Bending Moment Diagrams</h2><p>Shear force and bending moment diagrams show the value of the shear force and bending moment along the length of a beam. Once drawn, it makes it very easy to identify critical cross-sections, or the cross-sections with the highest bending moment and shear forces, which are the locations most likely to fail under the diagrammed loading scenario. These are then the cross-sections that you, as the design engineer, will look at when doing calculations. The other cross-sections are less important and don't need to be worked with unless there are discontinuities in the material or geometry (this is a topic you can learn about (a lot) more in Machine Design I (ME 352)). [3]</p><h3 id="id-5.ShearForceandBendingMomentDiagrams-SignConventions">Sign Conventions</h3><p>It is most common to make cut in the beam and look at the internal forces on the left side of the cut. If that is done, then shear force is positive in the downward direction and bending moment is positive in the counterclockwise direction. If you look at the right side of the cut face, then it is the opposite. [3]</p><p><br/></p><p>The variable used for shear forces is V, and the variable used for bending moment is M.</p><h3 id="id-5.ShearForceandBendingMomentDiagrams-HowtoMaketheDiagrams.[14][3]">How to Make the Diagrams. [14][3]</h3><ol><li>Calculate the reaction forces and moments using the equilibrium equations (sum of the forces in each direction equals zero, sum of the moments about each axis equals zero)</li><li>Break the beam into segments from left to right. There should only be one new force or moment per segment, so the number of segments that you will need will vary depending on the loading condition of the beam.</li><li>Compute the shear forces and moments for each segment sequentially. Remember to include the unknown V and M variables at the left face of the cut. Record these values. Note that the bending  moment will be dependent on the x-distance along the beam (some shear force values may also be if there is a distributed force rather than a force acting at a single point).</li><li>Plot the shear force and bending moment diagrams. Using the function for each section that you calculated above. </li><li>Analyze the diagram. Determine which cross-sections have the highest values of shear or bending moments. These are the critical cross-sections that will be analyzed further in the next sections.</li></ol><p>See the link below for a detailed walk-through of this process:</p><p>[14] <a class="external-link" href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Shear_and_moment_diagram" rel="nofollow">https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Shear_and_moment_diagram</a></p><p><br/></p><h2 id="id-5.ShearForceandBendingMomentDiagrams-References:">References:</h2><p>[1] <a class="external-link" href="https://web.mst.edu/~chiep/FE%20Review%20Files/MechanicsofMaterials.doc" rel="nofollow">https://web.mst.edu/~chiep/FE%20Review%20Files/MechanicsofMaterials.doc</a></p><p>[3] Napoli, Alessandra 2020</p><p>[12] <a class="external-link" href="http://web.mit.edu/4.441/1_lectures/1_lecture5/1_lecture5.html" rel="nofollow">http://web.mit.edu/4.441/1_lectures/1_lecture5/1_lecture5.html</a></p><p>[14] <a class="external-link" href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Shear_and_moment_diagram" rel="nofollow">https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Shear_and_moment_diagram</a></p><p>[15] <a class="external-link" href="https://www.bu.edu/moss/files/2015/03/bending_linearstress.jpg" rel="nofollow">https://www.bu.edu/moss/files/2015/03/bending_linearstress.jpg</a></p>
