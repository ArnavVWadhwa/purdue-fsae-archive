Once that is completed, I would begin my design by looking at the properties of different bearings. Even though the bearings are within the upright rather than the hub, I believe this will be a crucial point to both designs as it should help in eliminating the compliance issue that we faced with the prior year. From there I would then move into determining the necessary sizes for hub nuts, the circumference of the hub based on the bearing and tolerances for the floating disc design. </span></p><p><strong>Timeline:</strong></p><p>Refer to task list</p><p><strong>Costs:</strong></p><p>TBD</p><p><strong>Questions to answer:</strong></p><ul><li><span>Why do we need a hub?</span><ul><li>Hubs are necessary as they are the connecting point between the suspension setup and the wheels. </li></ul></li><li><span>What forces go through the hub?</span><ul><li><span>Torque (rotational force) from the half shaft to the hub.</span><ul><li><span>Produced by the engine.</span></li></ul></li><li><span>Torque (rotational force) from the brakes to the hub when the car slows down.</span></li><li><span>Normal Force absorbed from the tire due to different moments creating suspension travel.</span></li><li><span>Lateral forces </span><ul><li><span>Cornering left and right and skidding</span></li><li><span>Force of friction created by the tire.</span></li><li><span>Coefficient of Friction.</span></li></ul></li></ul></li><li><span>What subsystems work through the hub?</span><ul><li><span>The entire suspension system will work through the hub as other than the wheel center, the hub is the farthest outboard part that is manufactured by the team.</span></li><li><span>Drive Train, specifically the half shafts will also work through the rear hubs as the half shaft connects to the rear hubs.</span></li></ul></li></ul><p><strong>Constraints</strong></p><ul><li><span>Thermals </span><ul><li><span>Provide adequate strength in the hottest thermal environment/try to reduce heat transfer </span><ul><li><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);">How Hot does it Get?</span><ul><li><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);">Roughly (no recorded data) 250 F or 120 C.</span></li></ul></li><li><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);">What is the maximum heat that the material can take before yielding?</span><ul><li><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);">Quick Search</span><ul><li><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);">Aluminum tends to lose strength around 150 celcius and really show degrading around 200 celcius (<a class="external-link" href="https://firesciencereviews.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40038-015-0007-5" rel="nofollow">https://firesciencereviews.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40038-015-0007-5</a>)</span></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li><li><span>Thermal expansion has been considered and is not a problem with interfacing components. </span><ul><li><span>Hub and Upright interactions (bearing meets hub)</span></li><li><span>Floating Brake Disc Design </span><ul><li><span>How to make sure the brake discs stay floating and don't lose their intended play</span></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li><li><span>Structures </span><ul><li><span>Mass as low as possible </span></li><li><span>Margins as close to 0% for all load cases</span><ul><li><span>Margins are the % stress you are away from your design load case</span><ul><li><span>Ex: if we were to have a 15% margin, then a 15% increase in load (from what was originally designed) would not meet the design criteria.</span></li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Hub is able to survive the seasons (duh)<ul><li>Hubs will not need to be replaced throughout the entire season </li><li><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);">Define what the cycle of the hub is.</span><ul><li><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);">The cycle is basically the expiration date for the hub. </span><ul><li><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);">How much mileage can the hub take till it needs to be replaced?</span></li></ul></li><li><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);">In order to determine this we are going to want to run an FEA model putting the proper forces on the hub for x amount of cycles until it fails.
