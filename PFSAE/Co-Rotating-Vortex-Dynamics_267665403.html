                    <p><u><strong>Merge of Equal Strength Vortex Pair</strong></u></p><p>Two co-rotating vortices can merge into a singular vortex. This doesn't always happen of course, and neither is it always desirable when it does happen.</p><p>Say you have a pair of equal strength co-rotating vortices placed significantly far away from each other so that they don't merge initially. As the vortices travel downstream, the two vortices grow in size by means of diffusion. At some point, the ratio of core size and separation distance reach a value large enough so that the merging process can begin. This occurs in three steps:</p><ol><li>The first stage of vortex merging is called the diffusive stage (a-b). At this stage, the two co-rotating vortices started to deformed due to the shear stress exerted on each other. They tend to rotate around each other in this process, which should be easy to understand if you go over the analysis we did for counter-rotating vortices.</li><li>The second stage is called the convective stage (c-d). At this stage, filamentation starts. Filamentation is the process in which vortex filaments (or lines) start to occur. Also in this stage, vorticity from the cores start to migrate over to each other, and some vorticity is lost as vorticity enters the exchange bend (the place where two vortices connect).</li><li>The third stage is called the entrainment stage (e). In this stage, the original structures have significantly weakened and two cores are mitigating towards each other rapidly. The structure induced by the two cores also grow in strength significantly at this stage (again, think about shear stress). At the end, the two original cores are completely destroyed, and the single induced vortex remains. The two vortices have merged.</li></ol><p><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper confluence-embedded-manual-size"><img class="confluence-embedded-image" draggable="false" width="600" src="attachments/267665403/267665811.png" data-image-src="attachments/267665403/267665811.png" data-unresolved-comment-count="0" data-linked-resource-id="267665811" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="attachment" data-linked-resource-default-alias="image-2023-8-16_21-19-44.png" data-base-url="https://wiki.itap.purdue.edu" data-linked-resource-content-type="image/png" data-linked-resource-container-id="267665403" data-linked-resource-container-version="4" alt=""></span></p><p><u><strong>Interactions of Two Unequal Co-Rotating Vortex Pair</strong></u></p><p>Interactions of two unequal co-rotating vortex pairs is more tricky. The interaction is a function of vortex core radius, separation distance, and the vorticity distribution inside the vortex. The interactions can be classified into 5 catagories:</p><ol><li>Elastic interactions: the weaker vortex core undergoes a small deformation, but there is no vorticity loss due to filamentation</li><li>Partial straining out: part of the vorticity of the weaker vortex is lost to filamentation, but no vorticity is entrained into the larger vortex</li><li>Complete straining out: all of the vorticity of the weaker vortex is lost to filamentation, leading to its complete destruction, but no vorticity is entrained into the larger vortex</li><li>Partial merger: part of the weaker vortex core is lost to filamentation, some of its vorticity is entrained into the stronger vortex, and some of it remains. At the end of the interaction, there are still two vortices remaining</li><li>Complete merger: all of weaker vortex's vorticity is either lost to filamentation or entrained into the stronger vortex, leading to the complete destruction of the weaker vortex.</li></ol><p><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper confluence-embedded-manual-size"><img class="confluence-embedded-image" draggable="false" height="400" src="attachments/267665403/267667031.png" data-image-src="attachments/267665403/267667031.png" data-unresolved-comment-count="0" data-linked-resource-id="267667031" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="attachment" data-linked-resource-default-alias="image-2023-8-20_17-23-30.png" data-base-url="https://wiki.itap.purdue.edu" data-linked-resource-content-type="image/png" data-linked-resource-container-id="267665403" data-linked-resource-container-version="4" alt=""></span></p><p>There is no set relationship between the type of interactions and all of the variables that goes into it, that's the beauty of aerodynamics, but there are some trends that can be observed through experimentation:</p><ol><li>If there is a large difference between core radius between the two vortices, generally approaching an order of magnitude or above, a complete merger tends to not happen</li><li>Likewise, a complete merger tends to only happen when vorticity difference is relatively small</li><li>In the case of large difference between core radius and/or vorticity, a complete strain out is likely to happen, and you get no benefits of from the co-rotating system</li><li>Complete merger and complete strainÂ </li><li>Likewise, a complete merger tends to only happen when vorticity difference is relatively small</li><li>In the case of large difference between core radius and/or vorticity, a complete strain out is likely to happen, and you get no benefits of from the co-rotating system</li><li>Complete merger and complete strain out only happens when vortex separation distance is small (generally less than 3 or 4 vortex core radius, unless vorticity difference and/or core radius difference is large)</li><li>At high separation distances, elastic interaction dominates</li><li>Partial merger and partial straining out are relatively rare interactions that only exists in between complete strain out/complete merger and elastic interactions</li><li>Generally partial strain outs happen at higher separation distances than partial merger</li></ol>
