                    <p><u><strong>Introduction </strong></u></p><p>I (Theo) am being a bit selfish in that these pages are really for me to keep track of everything and to understand every detail of what I'm doing for the RW structures this year tbh...butÂ </p><p>This page is to document the decision-making process for the RW structural design for PF24. &quot;Oh structures is easy&quot;, &quot;RW structures is so simple&quot;, ok sure. But fact is we have documented some funky structures practices on aero in the past and the RW is, yes, a simple but also very understandable structure. Hence, I think it's a good starting point for new members to get an idea of the decision-making process behind structures. This is not a Bible for dos and don'ts of structures since it's my first real crack at it but when members in the future dig through the files from the past, they can reference this series and understand why I did what I did. ok enough</p>
