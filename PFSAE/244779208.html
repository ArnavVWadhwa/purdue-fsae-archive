                    <p>First step is to reach out to the general VR3 email (info@VR3.ca). They'll send you a really long generic email with all the steps to submit an order (I included the email I received from them below, it'll probably be really similar year to year). It took me a day or two to put all the files together (you'll need to make a drawing and excel sheet) and then you'll probably need to change a couple things before it's good to be ordered. I would say about a week or week and a half to get everything correct for VR3. Then there's the 2 week manufacturing time (for PF23 the tubes shipped 1 day after 2 weeks but then arrived the day after they shipped). </p><p><strong>Helpful Hints</strong></p><ul style="list-style-type: square;"><li>each tube will need to be saved as an individual file, when you do this make sure you name it the number of the tube (you'll need to do this at some point for VR3 so it's easiest to just do it the first time)</li><li>VR3 uses Solidworks so you'll need to export the file from NX to a step file. there's a quick way to export and entire assembly that also makes it easy for VR3 to open the whole frame assembly at once (check this page <u><a class="external-link" href="https://community.sw.siemens.com/s/question/0D54O000061xUpmSAE/how-to-export-a-nx-assembly-to-step-with-assembly-structure" rel="nofollow">out</a>,</u> but basically there's a box you need to check)</li><li>the drawing takes some time and i never found an easy way to do it automatically/ you kind of need to do it manually to get it exactly as VR3 wants it (would recommend just watch a couple videos on drawings in NX)</li><li>think about weld order when coping tubes</li><li>consider ordering extra coped tubes for welder practice</li></ul><p><br/></p><p><strong>VR3 Email</strong></p><p style="">This following information  is our standard response to initial inquiries from student teams such as  FSAE, Mini Baja, Solar vehicles and various other projects.</p><p style="">Our support is in the form of valuable technical support, discounted setup/review/programming costs, reduced manufacturing costs and efficient scheduling for producing and supplying these custom/ one-off chassis frames and accessories for your project.</p><p style="">This email information and related documents may be familiar but still beneficial to review and refresh requirements and provide suggestions.</p><p style="">This should answer the usual questions and provide guidelines to assist with this process.</p><p style=""><strong>Please review this information carefully.

Most other programs are compatible by exporting to parasolid (*.x_t) or step (*.stp)  formats  provided the tube components and features are modeled as ‘SOLID BODIES;’ and not segmented surface features or other non-geometric features.</p><p style="">                e) The tube manufacturing data is extracted directly from the cad files. Therefore it is very important that the details (tube sizes, trims, bend features) are compatible with the manufacturing process.</p><p style=""><br/></p><p style="">4.

Bend Features:</p><p style="">                a) Bend features are the most challenging aspect of tube structures</p><p style="">                b) The bend features must be compatible with our specific / available bend dies and minimum wall thickness requirements.</p><p style="">                                ** Tube bends are made with fixed radius bend dies that are not adjustable.</p><p style="">                                ** Thin wall tubes (.035”, .049”, .065” ) require larger bend radii / dies to avoid flattening or buckling or other deformation unless using expensive mandrel bending equipment and associated setup costs.</p><p style="">                                ** refer to the attached bend guideline document</p><p style="">                c) refer to our checklist document for additional  information</p><p style="">                d) bend radii for typical fsae projects (1.000”od tubes):</p><p style="">                                1.000”od x .095”wall:  bend radii can be either 3.25” or 5.88” clr (centerline radius)</p><p style="">                                1.000”od x .065”wall:  bend radii can be either 3.25” or 5.88” clr</p><p style="">                                1.000”od x .049”wall: bend radii must be 5.88” clr</p><p style="">                                1.000”od x .035”wall: bend radii must be 5.88”clr</p><p style="">                e) bend radii for typical baja projects  (1.250”od tubes):</p><p style="">                                1.250”od x .065”wall:  bend radii can be either 4.41” or 5.96” clr (centerline radius)</p><p style="">                                1.250”od x .049”wall:  bend radii must be 5.96” clr</p><p style="">                                1.250”od x .035”wall: bend radii must be 5.96”clr</p><p style=""><br/></p><p style="">7. Welded Chassis Frames:</p><p style="">                a)           <span> </span><span class="mark2kyp8yqs9" style="color: inherit;">VR3</span><span> </span>can also provide GTAW/TIG welding services for  FSAE style chassis that uses our cnc notched tube sets.</p><p style="">                b)            It is most economical if we provide the primary structural frame only, attachments are best added and verified by the student team.</p><p style="">                c)            ‘design for manufacturing’ details become more important if<span> </span><span class="mark2kyp8yqs9" style="color: inherit;">VR3</span><span> </span>is providing welding services</p><p style="">                d)            Pricing primarily depends on:  quality of design documents, number of pieces, complexity of the geometry, tube cluster configuration (T-joints, mitre joints), amount of fixturing required, etc.  <span> </span><span class="mark2kyp8yqs9" style="color: inherit;">VR3</span><span> </span>may be more critical of the tube details and frame configuration to simplify and better facilitate weld assembly/welding.</p><p style="">                e)            Suspension mounts are an additional challenging aspect of welded frames due to tolerances and orientations in 3D space. Special fixturing may be required. We often recommend only tack welding the mounting brackets so that the positioning and tolerances can be verified with the actual A arms and related assembly before final welding. There are always options</p><p style="">                f)             We may also suggest some changes to the tube configuration to better suit or simplify weld assembly if we will be welding in our shop.</p><p style="">                g)            If<span> </span><span class="mark2kyp8yqs9" style="color: inherit;">VR3</span><span> </span>is welding, the required documents / drawings need to be done better than when providing the tube parts only. Additional dimensional drawings of the weld assembly will be required to facilitate fixturing, weld assembly, reference dimensions and inspection of the overall frame.</p><p style="">                h)            Another challenging aspect of welding is scheduling. This is more difficult to control and is very dependent on the backlog at the time of order.</p><p style="">                i)             Ball park pricing will range from $4000 to $ 6000 in addition to the tube kit above.  Shipping will also be an additional $200 to $500 for skidding and shipping a bulky frame.</p><p style="">                j)             Scheduling could take anywhere from 3 weeks to 8 weeks for a welded chassis frame, subject to our workload/backlog at time of order.</p><p style="">                k)            Provide as much advance notice as possible if interested in this option. Avoid late season scheduling.</p><p style="">                l)             A reminder these are one-off frames, with minimal allowance for special fixturing.</p><p style="">                m)          Once released for manufacture, changes become expensive and scheduling stretches out quickly.</p><p style=""><br/></p><p style=""><span style="color: black;">8.
