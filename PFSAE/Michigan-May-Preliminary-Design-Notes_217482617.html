                    <h2 id="MichiganMayPreliminaryDesignNotes-General">General</h2><p><br/></p><h2 id="MichiganMayPreliminaryDesignNotes-Suspension">Suspension</h2><p>Frank's Notes:</p><p>This is the 2nd year we've talked to Gene Lukianov for a design judge. He seems to be a very laid back person with a focus on fundamentals rather than fancy simulations. He'd much rather see that students have an understanding of fundamentals via use of FBDs and hand calculations. He didn't care much for the lap sim point sensitivities. For example, I think it would go a long way with scoring points with him if we walked through the process of using TTC data to draw and FBD of the tire contact patch, then used those moment calcs to develop tierod loads and then therefore develop steering loads. He also highly values  considerations for the ergonomic aspect of suspension such as steering and braking input forces.</p><p>Aside from the &quot;Gene Specific&quot; comments, it also seems like the appendix should be more thorough. For the most part, the judges believed that we did all the calculations with our fundamental structures hand calcs, but having those margins and actual spreadsheets printed out would help a lot with some of the discussions.</p><p><br/></p><ul><li>How did you incorporate driver confidence in the vehicle?<ul><li>Talked about the tires and driver input</li></ul></li><li>Talked about aero and integration with suspension </li><li>Talked about chassis and integration with suspension</li><li>Elaborated on all suspension kinematics </li><li>Talked about drivability and tuning, how those two effected each other</li><li>Wanted to understand the physics of brakes<ul><li>Don't need &quot;fancy simulation tools&quot;, excel will do fine</li></ul></li><li>&quot;Hook&quot; oversteer w/ bump steer out in rear and bump steer in on front</li></ul><p><a class="confluence-userlink user-mention" data-username="zmacnab" href="https://wiki.itap.purdue.edu/display/~zmacnab" data-linked-resource-id="185500260" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="userinfo" data-base-url="https://wiki.itap.purdue.edu">MacNab, Zachary Robert</a> <a class="confluence-userlink user-mention" data-username="crookst" href="https://wiki.itap.purdue.edu/display/~crookst" data-linked-resource-id="187079839" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="userinfo" data-base-url="https://wiki.itap.purdue.edu">Crooks, Troy A</a>  to fill out specific questions asked</p><h2 id="MichiganMayPreliminaryDesignNotes-Chassis">Chassis</h2><p>The judge was hard to hear, the questions were recorded as best as possible.</p><p>How did you determine the requirements and how did you measure them? (process for determining the frame design, not sure i was asked about measuring them)</p><p>There was some question about stress relieving, but I couldn't hear the majority of the question</p><p>Why did you choose the steel and filler types for the chassis?</p><p>How did you predict torsion rigidity?</p><p>How did you test and compare the rigidity to the ansys model?</p><p>Did you expect the chassis to be stiffer than the model?</p><p>How did you model the chassis?</p><p>How many constraints and degrees of freedom did the chassis have for the torsion test?</p><p>Describe your manufacturing process?</p><p>What was your welding strategy and how did you approach it?</p><p>Did you tack everything and weld later, or did you fully weld as you went? (wanted to know if we removed the frame from the jigs after tacking or not)</p><p>Did you measure the final locations of the sus points?</p><p>How did your actual sus points compare to the cad?</p><p>Why are you using the standard impact attenuator and what are the advantages of using a custom one?</p><p><br/></p><p>Feedback from Chris (judge):</p><ul style="list-style-type: square;"><li>a really optimized frame weighs around 60 lbs so there's room for improvement (acknowledged that might have a negative impact/ not make sense with our LLTD approach)</li><li>suggested we don't need stress relief for the frame</li><li>better measurement check of frame (SUS points)</li><li>choose a filler rod stronger than 4130</li><li>want stronger correlation between ANSYS &amp; torsion test (constrain test different to not over constrain / misrepresent rigidity)</li><li>need better understanding of degrees of freedom</li></ul><p><br/></p><p>Helen's thoughts:</p><ul style="list-style-type: square;"><li>the judge was split up between frame and ergonomics so only about 20-25 minutes was spent explaining the frame, which i think was sufficient time for the content i wanted to talk about</li><li>conversation was mostly was focused on our approach for a frame/ torsional rigidity and making sure we understood the impact of chassis rigidity </li><li>needed a better understanding of degrees of freedom in ANSYS and how that impacts our torsion test/ leads to a stiffer TR output from the test since the chassis is over constrained </li><li>didn't really talk about analysis of different load cases or lugs in the first round (if there was one judge focused just on the frame we would have had time to cover that stuff but tbh i wasn't as confident in it so i didn't want to bring it up)</li><li>spent a little bit of time talking about manufacturing so i think it's important to know about the welding and jigging and why we made those decisions but it wasn't the focus of the conversation</li></ul><p>Design Finals Questions:</p><p>What material is holding the engine on?</p><p>Have you done analysis for bumps?</p><p>How are you constraining the chassis in ansys?</p><p>What are the boundary conditions?</p><p>Have you looked at fatigue failure?<br/>How long do you plan to use the car and how many launches do you plan on doing?</p><p>What is torsional rigidity and why is it important?</p><p>How are you constraining the model and applying the forces for the LLTD model.</p><p>how many constraints to be correctly constrained to prevent it from moving and how do it in terms of the chassis?</p><p>is your torsion test correctly constrained?</p><p>What is your frame material and why?</p><p>What is the thickness and Diameter and why?<br/>How does the change in torsion change the endurance time?</p><p>How do you correlate the LLTD% to lap times&gt;</p><p>What are you missing from using a quasi-state model i.e. skidpad for turns</p><p>What inputs cause vibrations of concern and how do you deal with them?</p><p>What is the point of the suspension?</p><h2 id="MichiganMayPreliminaryDesignNotes-Powertrain">Powertrain</h2><p>How do you size the radiators?</p><p>Asked about the oil pressure graph</p><ul style="list-style-type: square;"><li>Thought it was hard to read, inconclusive</li><li>Asked about the variation between points</li><li>Wanted to know the minimum oil pressure the car saw</li></ul><p>How did we design the intake?</p><p>Carson showed how our WAVE and real-life horsepower graphs peak in the same region.</p><p>Thought the exhaust graph was poor and needed to be cleared up to better show our model results.</p><p>Radiators:</p><ul style="list-style-type: square;"><li>Asked about the flow through the radiators</li><li>Asked is we put our measured data back in the lap-sim</li></ul><p>How does your spark timing vary with coolant temp?</p><p>Asked how we handle knock events</p><ul style="list-style-type: square;"><li>Carson explained how we have a knock sensor and how it is set up (judge really seemed to like)</li></ul><p>Why is there a flat spot in timing vs coolant temp map?</p><p>Suggested that we also compensate timing based on air temperature rather than just coolant.</p><p>Carson and Dom explained how we get synchronization (also seemed to really like)</p><p>Asked about min/max for injector.</p><p>What are our lambda targets?</p><p>Asked if our fuel system is E-85 safe.</p><p>What defines a good or bad launch for the lap-sim?</p><ul style="list-style-type: square;"><li>Carson also explained the calculations for the different launch control settings</li></ul><p>Carson explained our fuel-film compensation and how it has helped with starting.</p><p>Judges impressed with our power levels.</p><p>Judges liked the lap-sim validation.</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>Sloppy handwriting for now, will transcribe later</p><p><span
