                    <h3 id="DriverSkillDeltas-2018MichiganCompetition">2018 Michigan Competition</h3><p>Compiled data from 2019 endurance and took a look at differences between driver average endurance times as a function of placement in endurance. It looks like the top 10 finishing teams have differences between drivers of less than 4%. Given that there is going to be extra variance from issues with other cars on track, the reality is that the drivers are probably even closer in capability. I think the takeaway from this is that, during driver training (particularly of your endurance drivers), you should focus on the slower of the two drivers with training time as long as both drivers have had enough seat time to be comfortable. Assuming driver capability approaches an asymptote, it follows that there will be more benefit from focusing on the slower driver.</p><p>Also, I expected to see big differences in how quickly lap times improved between the best teams and those further down. This was not the case. It seems like drivers across the board reach a lap time that will be about what they hold on the second lap. I still think that emphasizing track learning capability is going to be important, but it looks like the major differences between good an bad drivers is more what they can do with the car.</p><p><br/></p><p>the compiled data:</p><p><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper"><a class="confluence-embedded-file" href="/download/attachments/156599277/endurance_lap_time_data_2019.xlsx?version=1&amp;modificationDate=1598487911000&amp;api=v2" data-nice-type="Excel Spreadsheet" data-file-src="/download/attachments/156599277/endurance_lap_time_data_2019.xlsx?version=1&amp;modificationDate=1598487911000&amp;api=v2" data-linked-resource-id="156599278" data-linked-resource-type="attachment" data-linked-resource-container-id="156599277" data-linked-resource-default-alias="endurance_lap_time_data_2019.xlsx" data-mime-type="application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet" data-has-thumbnail="true" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-can-edit="true" aria-label="endurance_lap_time_data_2019.xlsx" draggable="false"><img src="rest/documentConversion/latest/conversion/thumbnail/156599278/1" height="250" alt="" draggable="false"/></a><span class="companion-edit-button-placeholder edit-button-overlay" data-linked-resource-container-id="156599277" data-linked-resource-id="156599278" data-template-name="companionEditIcon" data-source-location="embedded-attachment"></span></span></p><p><br/></p><h3 id="DriverSkillDeltas-2021MichiganCompetition">2021 Michigan Competition</h3><p><br/></p>
