                    <h3 id="Harness:Inventory-Background:">Background:</h3><p>Because there are so many purchased components used in a wiring harness, and because extra/spares of items are often ordered, it is important to take stock of what the team has so that you can make the most efficient use of money. It is also possible that the team already owns a desired component that would be too expensive to buy otherwise (ECU, PDM, Paddles, etc.). What components the team has already will not only influence major harness architecture decisions but will also affect the harness down to a pinout level. It is important to be proactive with this process because of the large chain of influence component selection holds and how early in the process it is begun. </p><h3 id="Harness:Inventory-TakingStock:">Taking Stock:</h3><p>The major items that need to be accounted for when it comes to harness design are:</p><ol><li>Control Units/High-Cost Items</li><li>Components/Sensors</li><li>Connectors</li><li>Wire</li><li>Heatshrink</li></ol><p><br/></p><p>The items above are listed in the order in which they would first affect harness design. Major decisions to be made before the pinout even begins would be based on control unit and high-cost item availability, sensor and component stock will then begin to affect pinout creation and component selection, and the other items become an issue when trying to estimate harness cost, connector usage, and wire color usage.</p><p><br/></p><p>The four pieces of information that should be taken from a round of inventory are:</p><ol><li>What We Have</li><li>How Many We Have</li><li>State Of What We Have (New/Used)</li><li>Where We Have It</li></ol><p><br/></p><p>The first two items on this list are self-explanatory. The state of a given component is important to know depending on the item. For example, it would be ideal to use new sensors for critical components such as MAP or TPS and leave used ones as spares but this is not always possible, and knowing early on that the team is missing a sensor or component that might be difficult to source can be very important when it comes to the reliability of the car later on. It should be noted that broken/items that are known not to work properly should not be accounted for during inventory (and if they are their state should be expressly noted to avoid confusion later on). The &quot;where&quot; of an item is more of an ease-of-life piece of information than one that would have a significant influence on actions early in the design process. As the team continues to grow and spread out across campus (and Klondike <img class="emoticon emoticon-1f61e" data-emoji-id="1f61e" border="0" src="plugins/servlet/twitterEmojiRedirector" alt="disappointed face" title="disappointed face"/>) it becomes increasingly important to know where things are; this holds even down to a trackbox level. Knowing exactly where everything is at all times will save a great deal of time in the long run.</p><h3 id="Harness:Inventory-DesignForInventory(DFI):">Design For Inventory (DFI):</h3><p>Good documentation of the previous year's harness and component usage will save a great deal of time during this stage of the design process. While the harness could be created completely independently and there still be a great deal of convergence on the components that were selected, it will be helpful to be proactive about component usage to avoid having to change things later on. <strong>It should be noted here that just because a component was used on the previous year's car does not mean it was properly selected for the application. Do not be afraid to change the component being used for an application if the change is justified, people make mistakes and the car is also very subject to change each year.</strong></p><div class="confluence-information-macro confluence-information-macro-information"><span class="aui-icon aui-icon-small aui-iconfont-info confluence-information-macro-icon"></span><div class="confluence-information-macro-body"><p>Please See: <u><a href="265098844.html">Harness: Component Selection</a></u></p></div></div><h3 id="Harness:Inventory-Timeline:">Timeline:</h3><ul><li>End of Previous School Year → Rough inventory of sensors/components, and control units/high-cost items</li><li>Beginning of Design Cycle School Year → Detailed inventory of everything to verify previous design decisions, influence future ones, and estimate spending</li></ul>
