                    <p>Testing on new fuel tank. It did 60 to 62 laps before fuel starvation occurred. Endurance length corresponds to 56 laps, so this is 5-10% extra. 10 minutes of idling at 4k rpm was included in this, and driving was near top pace. There was also some extra idling due to electronics charge system troubleshooting. This provided confidence in capacity of new fuel tank.</p><p><br/></p><p>The charge issue that had been happening for a while finally reached the level of preventing the car from running a full endurance. It was subsequently found to be caused by bad crimps on the engine side of the connector going between the stator and rectifier. This was combined with a mostly failed rectifier. Seems likely crimps caused rectifier failure but this is speculation. All crimps were bad enough to be able to be removed by hand. Heat damage was apparent near crimps.</p><p><br/></p><p>Data liink:</p><p><a class="external-link" href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1QuF80MV5bJkeHSdD1-_-Oa4YGvdW3rai" rel="nofollow">All Test Data 5-19-21 Grand Prix (1) (1) - Google Drive</a></p>
