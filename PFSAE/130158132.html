                    <h2 id="DesignEventNotesPF15|AER-2015FSAEMichiganDesignJudgingEvent–Aerodesignjudgequestions"><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);"><strong>2015 FSAE Michigan Design Judging Event – Aero design judge questions</strong></span></h2><p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);">Q: Take me front of the car to the rear and explain how you designed each component.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);">A: Before that, let me explain the overall approach we took. (Explained Summary: Objectives, Calculations, Predictions, skipping structures because judge did not seem interested)</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);"><br/></span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);">Q: How did you decide the location of the CP (center of pressure) with respect to the CG (center of gravity)?</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);">A: Generally, you want the CP to be behind the CG for positive stability. We determined, in CFD, the setting that would give neutral stability then used track testing to determine settings for each event. We found that for skidpad, a low speed and near steady state event, a neutral or slightly unstable balance was desired. For higher speed and transient events such as autocross or endurance, a CP location behind the CG was desired.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);"><br/></span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);">Q: How do the vertical end plates contribute to vehicle stability?</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);">A: Since the majority of endplate area is behind the CG, they act like a vertical tail on an aircraft and provide a restoring moment when the vehicle yaws or experiences cross wind that turns the vehicle into the wind. This prevents high speed oversteer. Unlike aircrafts, cars are in constant contact with the ground, so forces are also transmitted through tire friction. This translates longitudinal stability into lateral stability, meaning front/rear downforce distribution contributes to yaw stability. (Downforce distribution actually matters more because downforce is generally designed to be greater in magnitude than drag and racing tires usually have frictional coefficients greater than 1.)</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);"><br/></span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);">Q: What is the symmetry of the aerodynamic system?</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);">A: It is designed to be left-right symmetric.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);"><br/></span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);">Q: Did you consider tuning it asymmetrically for certain events?</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);">A: Not for skidpad because it has 2 rights and 2 lefts. Autocross and endurance are usually run counter-clockwise, so there would be more left turns than right turns. However, our drivers are students with little experience and practice, so it is unrealistic to expect them to be able to exploit the extra performance gained, if any, from tuning the vehicle asymmetrically. On top of that, it is difficult to determine the amount of asymmetry to tune in when we do not get any testing time on the course we will compete in.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);">(Judge argues it’s worth it for the performance, I restate how undertrained our drivers are…)</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);"><br/></span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);">Q: Did you determine what L/D is optimal for each event?</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);">A: For acceleration, drag is minimized. For skidpad, downforce is maximized. Autocross and endurance courses are difficult to predict and we have not created a MATLAB simulation to do so. We use the L/D that maximizes downforce while maintaining the desired front/rear downforce distribution.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);"><br/></span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);">Q: There is an optimal L/D for each track, and it is your job to determine that.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);">A: Ok. That is something we will look into.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);"><br/></span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);">Q: What is the most important corner on a race track (for aero)?</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);">A: The fastest corner.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);"><br/></span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);">Q: It is actually the braking zone right after a fast section. Why is that? Why is it important to be able to brake late?</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);">A: Drag and downforce both help the braking performance of the car. Braking later means more speed can be gained. This is more important than the speed gained in the beginning of an acceleration zone because at higher speeds, a given delta-v will allow more distance to be travelled.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);"><br/></span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);">Q: It is also a matter of defense/offense since you can be passed or pass someone if you have better braking performance.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);">A: That is true in real racing. However, in FSAE, we are only allowed to pass in straight acceleration zones. This lowers the emphasis on optimizing for braking and shifts some of that focus into reducing drag for better acceleration performance.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);"><br/></span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);">Q: How did you validate your predictions experimentally?</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);">A: (Flip to 5.1) We measured downforce with linear potentiometers attached to the shocks. These measured spring displacement while the car travels at constant speed in a straight line. This was done using the ECU to limit engine speed. The data was averaged at each speed, and a quadratic fit was produced. This was compared to the CFD results and 96% accuracy was achieved. However, because of the noise of the data, this has a large uncertainty.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);"><br/></span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);">Q: How did you filter out the noise (from shock pots)? Did you use any sort of filters (band-pass, butterworth, etc…) to remove unwanted frequencies?</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);">A: No, we were not looking for frequencies so time dependence did not really matter. The mean value was taken at each constant speed. We assumed that noise from imperfections in the road or wind would average out because we took data for long durations.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);"><br/></span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);">Q: You still could have used the RMS to prevent skewing.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);">A: We will consider that next time.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);">(Flip to 5.3) Flow visualization was also done using tufts on the low pressure side of the airfoil surface. Most of the surface area was seen to have laminar attached flow, with the tufts going straight back. Behind the mounting points, turbulent oscillations can be observed due to the vortex shedding from the cylindrical tubes. No areas experienced separated flow (looking at pictures from going in a straight line), which would cause the tufts to point opposite of the flow direction due to the recirculating flow.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);">We also planned to perform coast-down testing to measure the drag, but several mechanical failures prevented us from doing so.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);"><br/></span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);">Q: I know several people in the industry and government (EPA) researching cost down testing, and it is very difficult to separate the aerodynamic forces from frictional forces.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);">A: (Flip to 4.2) We actually did that by creating an ODE that assumes drag force varies quadratically with velocity while frictional forces are constant. When solved, this gives an equation with two constants that separate the two forces. A curve fit of velocity over time is then used to find the value of the constants.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);"><br/></span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);">Q: (Something about it being very difficult and needing iteration to find constants)</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);">A: We actually created MATLAB code using the optimization toolbox to iterate and minimize the error to find the constants.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);"><br/></span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);">Q: In my colleagues research, they found some things that gave them much better estimates: (Something about doing tests in different intervals: 80-60mph, 40-20mph, etc, and an empirically determined, unpublished 3:1 ratio between aero forces and friction forces)</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);">A: That’s interesting, and we will consider that in future testing.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);">(Talked about skidpad test &amp; tune: tuned in tandem with suspension, faster with lower front wing height, ran out of ground clearance before downforce dropped off)</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);">(Talked about future plans)</span></p>
