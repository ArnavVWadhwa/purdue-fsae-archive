                    <p>(Superseded by Clone assembly section here: <a href="NX-Tool-Specific-Tutorials_143759157.html">NX Tool Specific Tutorials</a>)</p><p>Using the layout file method can make life a little more confusing when you want to create a revision. You've got a layout file that defines parts that are in your final assembly that is actually in the vehicle CAD. You want to end up with new part numbers for the layout file, the individual parts, and the assembly; however, you want to avoid breaking any of the dependencies in the old part numbers so that you actually have an old version saved off. Here's what to do:</p><ol><li>Open the layout file, all the individual parts, and the assembly</li><li>Save as the layout file to its new number. This will update the links in each of the parts that are open to the new layout file. It is critical that you don't accidentally save one of those parts now, because the old part will become attached to the new layout file.</li><li>Save as each of the parts to their new part numbers. This will update the parts in the layout file and in the assembly to the new numbers. Now it is critical that you don't accidentally save the assembly, because it would save the old part number assembly with the new part number parts swapped in.</li><li>Save as the assembly to the new part number. This will save the new assembly with the new parts, without permanently affecting the old assembly</li><li>Now you can save everything again and call it a day</li></ol><p><br/></p><p>Clone Assembly Tool: </p><p>This tool is useful for cloning an assembly in order to save a revision which keeps no links to the active assembly.
