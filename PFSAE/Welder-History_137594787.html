                    <p>The current Lincoln Precision Tig 275 has been with the team size at least 2015. It is believed that this welder was provided to the team through a Lincoln sponsorship that would loan us a welder and every year we would return the welder and receive a new one. Over time this communication was lost and the welder was not returned. We are currently trying to get re-upped in the program.</p><p><br/></p><p>Reasons we need the Precision Jig 275 with water-cooler. </p><ul><li>We need the high current for welding thicker aluminum, water-cooling makes this more comfortable/possible at high current.</li><li>The water-cooled torch also allows us to weld for longer/ nearly indefinite amounts of time before the torch is too warm to hold.</li><li>The 25ft torch lines is also very useful for reaching around the whole chassis while welding.</li></ul><p><br/></p><p>During the 2019 season welding the chassis the welder started to show its age. </p><p>The torch began to leak near the head, this was slightly fixed by reattaching the cooling hose to the torch. This was only a band-aid fix and eventually began to leak again. The torch also started to get warm. I believe this was because of a blockage in the water-cooling of the torch, this was fixed by cleaning out the torch with safety wire. This was only a temporary fix. <br/>I believe the reason for the torch blockages was the use of tap water, I think algae and minerals in the water caused the blockages. increased pressure and caused the cooling lines to weak. If tight radii with the torch can be avoided the cooling lines should be preserved longer, but I believe the torch lines have a finite life.</p><p><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;"><br/></span></p><p><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;"> In the fall of 2019, the whole torch(comes with </span>cooling<span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;"> lines)and cooling water was replaced. Torch coolant was used to avoid the same algae and mineral issues from prior. To date the cooling pump has been running </span>quieter than every with no leaks anywhere.</p><p><br/></p><p>Note: the coolant capacity is 2 gallons.</p>
