                    <h1 id="WheelNuts(PF20andPrior)-StockPrep(LathetoDropSaw)">Stock Prep (Lathe to Drop Saw)</h1><p>Start with disc of exact external dimensions of wheel nut. Recommended to prep stock for full planned quantity as CNC operation is quick so setup time is a significant portion of total time. Recommended to turn and face in same operation for each disc such that OD is perfectly perpendicular to one face. The other face may be out of parallel by approx .010&quot; with minimum repercussion.</p><p><br/></p><h1 id="WheelNuts(PF20andPrior)-HexFlats(CNCMill)">Hex Flats (CNC Mill)</h1><p>Since all discs being machined will be at same dimensions, can just place into 3 jaw layed on CNC mill table, find zero on one part, and then run all parts. Place each disc into the jaws on the face that is known to be perfectly parallel to the OD axis so that wrench feature aligns. This will assure that the hex can be clamped in the lathe to have good alignment when thread turning.</p><p><br/></p><h1 id="WheelNuts(PF20andPrior)-InternalThreads(ManualLathe)">Internal Threads (Manual Lathe)</h1><p>Drill to as close to thread minor diameter as possible (for 2018 - 2020 + design, 1.75&quot; drill bit is used). This drill bit is larger than 1/2&quot; so will need to pilot drill. Choose a pilot drill that is just larger than the web of 1.75&quot; drill bit. (The web of a drill bit is the flat part at the front of a drill bit that does not come to sharp point, which is typical for large drill bits). Break all the way through with both drill bits (duh). Use boring bar to finish to pre-thread diameter (just smaller than minor diameter, I think we get the value from MasterCam with some tool used for determining diameters prior to thread turning). Then thread turn.</p><p><br/></p>
