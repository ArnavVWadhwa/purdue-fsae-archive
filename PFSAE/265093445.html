                    <p><u><strong>Floor Edge Wings</strong></u></p><p>Look harder into wings instead of tunnels at floor edge. The vortex bursting there is almost impossible to control despite several attempts. So cutting it short and putting in wings should help. When I tried this, the wings didn't work very well due to vortex bursting itself. However, larger slot gaps, more elements at lower angle of attack, and lower angle of attack addition between elements could work.</p><p><u><strong>Floor Profile Optimization</strong></u></p><p>There is a lot more work that can be done about throats. I currently have a big suction peak with a stretch of flat section. This area is very sensitive. Even small changes to that geometry could yield more downforce.</p><p><u><strong>Diffuser Optimization</strong></u></p><p>Just like the suction peak, diffuser could use more work. And I'm not just talking about exit height. Lateral expansion might be useful. Maybe have it converging to deal with tire wake? </p><p><u><strong>Strakes</strong></u></p><p>Strakes is a very hard thing to get right. Essentially you want to use strakes to control inwash. But there is so much inwash from all directions that you really don't know what to do. But optimizing strakes to fill up more of the diffuser with high CpT flow is a lot of performance.</p><p><u><strong>Front Tire Wake</strong></u></p><p>I believe a lot of issues with undertray right now can be traced back to tire wake. The bulk rotation in the wake inwashes for undertray and outwashes and upwashes for rear wing, all three of which are not desirable. Although this likely just be CFD making things up (we have had correlation issues in this region), doing the reverse is going to help anyways regardless of existing flow structures. This can be achieved by either outwash the low wake or inwash the high wake.</p><p>Direct outwash low wake brings flow attachment issue which could affect side wings themselves. Outwash with pressurization on the inside of the tire is a good idea, but that requires a slimmer sidepod and much better front wing flow conditioning, which is not easy. Slimmer sidepods brings its own issues of exposing UT leading edge on top surface (if UT inlet stays the same), which is just flow separation asking to happen. If you make UT inlet slimmer as well, then you are trading off UT performance. So it's a balance play here that I don't know how it's going to play out. Pressurization on the sidepods can be increased by simply getting rid of separation across the leading edge we have right now. Even though this sound simple, it's actually very difficult since the separation is triggered by a vortex. You have a lot of outwash with different strength is that region, which makes flow alignment hard to impossible (even if you can do it in CFD, you have to worry about correlation). The best solution is move that vortex else where. Where? I have no idea. How? By changing front tire wake suppressor geometry.</p><p>Inwash the high wake can be interesting. The benefit is going to be less. Yes you are reducing the rotation rate of tire wake, but nothing in the world says wake has to rotate. My guess is this will reduce the rotation rate by a little bit, but also just stretch out the wake, which obviously isn't good. But if done right, this can be very helpful to rear wing, and undertray to some extent. </p>
