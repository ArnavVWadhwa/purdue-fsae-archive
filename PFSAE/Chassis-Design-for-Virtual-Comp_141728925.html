In order to accomplish this goal, decisions were analysed through a combination of quantifiable and non-quantifiable vehicle metrics. The quantifiable metrics were assigned point sensitivities through an in house quasi-static lap-time simulation which was used to objectively make design decisions. The chassis has a direct influence on quantifiable metrics including weight, CG, and aspects of suspension performance. Non-quantifiable metrics which are also critical to design performance include ergonomics and driver confidence. </p><p>The first step in chassis design was material selection. The two initial design proposals for the 2020 competition year are shown here. A steel frame design previously used by the team was selected over a partial monocoque as the potential weight savings of 10 lbs and resulting point gain of 4 did not out weigh the estimated increase in manufacturing timeline of 4 weeks. </p><p>4130 in combination with ER70S-2 filler rod and a post welding stress relief were the selected materials and processes for the space frame for a number of reasons. </p><ul style="list-style-type: square;"><li>no change in stiffness between 4130 and 1018 materials</li><li>access to   calculations for lugs from airframe stress analysis and sizing<br/><br/></li><li>reduced chance of cracking due to lower carbon content of ER70s-2 filler rod</li><li>no need for preheating, interpass, or postheating processes when used with 4130 &lt; 0.125 in</li><li>this does sacrifice weld strength</li><li>stress relief to temper martensite and reduce residual stresses </li><li>Other options <ul style="list-style-type: square;"><li>would be a post heating process but as described above this is not possible within the teams resources or necessary</li><li>full heat treatment is not necessary as increased strength is not needed and this would required different filler material as well as a post heat process</li></ul></li></ul><p><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;"> Next </span>overall<span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;"> vehicle design and chassis rules compliance were considered. </span></p><ul style="list-style-type: square;"><li><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;">CG 47% ideal, 49% selected for easier packaging and driver position</span></li><li><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;">Load paths for rules compliance and </span>minimum<span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;"> tubes</span></li><li><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;">bulkhead study</span></li><li><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;">engine height study iIMAGE OF PACKAGING</span><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;"><br/></span></li><li>ergo</li></ul><p>In order to meet the primary goal of driver safety, all safety critical structures (any single point of failure which would result in total loss of vehicle control) were analyzed and held to a 1.4 safety factor on ultimate failure. This is the value used for manned space flight taken from nasastd5001. This was done through a number of structures analysis tools created by the team using NASA-STD-5020 for hardware, calculations from Air Frame Stress Analysis and Sizing for lugs, and FEA in ANSYS for more complex larger structures. </p><ul style="list-style-type: square;"><li>Two force member calculator<ul style="list-style-type: square;"><li>Tensile yield </li><li><p>Compressive yield</p></li><li><p>Insert bond failure (for carbon tubes</p></li><li><p>Buckling (Euler vs Johnson)</p></li><li><p>Thread shear</p></li><li><p>Rod end failure</p></li></ul></li><li>Bolt calculator<ul style="list-style-type: square;"><li><p>Bolt tension</p></li><li>Bolt shear</li><li><p>Flange shear out</p></li><li><p>Bearing yield</p></li></ul></li><li>Lug calculator<ul style="list-style-type: square;"><li><p>Shear bearing failure </p></li><li>Tension Failure</li><li><p>Bearing yield failure </p></li><li><p>Weld shear out (SES calculations with fitting factor of 2)</p></li><li><p>Weld tensile failure (SES calculations with fitting factor of 2)</p></li></ul></li><li>FEA<ul style="list-style-type: square;"><li>5 elements through thickness or radius </li><li>mesh quality (jacobian &gt; 0.66, aspect ratio, averaging check) </li><li>Quadratic elements </li><li>Criteria for when it’s converged (three things?)</li></ul></li></ul><p>In order to meet our chassis performance goals chassis effect on LLTD as well as the effect of chassis compliance on Camber was also examined. LLTD describes the transfer of load to the outer tires during a cornering event. This is largely driven by factors such as track width, CG height, and suspension characteristics. By adjusting the ratio of LLTD to the front and the rear of the car oversteer and understeer behaviors can be tuned through suspension adjustments to driver preference due to tire load sensitivity (see graph). Because the suspension is designed with the assumption that the chassis is fully rigid, a chassis which is to &quot;Loose&quot; can result in a reduction of tune-ability of the car and behavior which does not correlate with suspension simulations. </p><ul style="list-style-type: square;"><li>Change in front spring rate (350 to 400) resulted in<ul style="list-style-type: square;"><li>1.44% change real</li><li>1.36% change rigid</li><li>0.08% more than expected</li></ul></li></ul><p>In order to validate the model a torsion test was completed on the finished chassis as well as the ANSYS beam element model used to determine the chassis effect on LLTD. The applied load was set at a value which ensured no plastic deformation of the chassis would occur by holding a SF of 5. The graphs below comparing amount of deformation seen in the cockpit area of the chassis (where the majority of deformation was expected) show the model correlated within 15% of the real vehicle. </p><h1 id="ChassisDesignforVirtualComp-Tasks">Tasks</h1><ul class="inline-task-list" data-inline-tasks-content-id="141728925"><li data-inline-task-id="2">Front impact FEA</li><li data-inline-task-id="6">Side impact FEA </li><li data-inline-task-id="15">Rollover FEA?</li><li data-inline-task-id="7">Suspension Load FEA</li><li class="checked" data-inline-task-id="16">Front Camber Change (numbers so low ignore rear)</li><li data-inline-task-id="17">Rear toe in cornering</li><li data-inline-task-id="18">Lug calculations make presentable (maybe do this for 1018 also to prove using 4130)</li><li data-inline-task-id="19">Shock and rocker lug calcs (maybe clean up the calculator)</li></ul><h1 id="ChassisDesignforVirtualComp-AppendixMaterial"><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);">Appendix Material</span></h1><p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);"><br/></span></p><h1 id="ChassisDesignforVirtualComp-Presentation">Presentation</h1><p><br/></p><h1 id="ChassisDesignforVirtualComp-ORDER">ORDER</h1><ol><li>READ THE CHAPTERS FROM RCVD</li><li>materials and reasons behind them </li><li>worst margins tensile, buckling, tab, etc. (chassis won't fail)</li><li>torsion test and model correlation to validate wheel loads simulation </li></ol><p><br/></p><h1 id="ChassisDesignforVirtualComp-Notesfromfirstdesignpracticeevent:">Notes from first design practice event:</h1><ul><li>Provide points anywhere weight is mentioned<ul><li>Spreadsheet with points sensitivities: Z:\2020\3_Suspension\01_Desigh\02_LapSim\Vehicle_Architecture_Tradeoffs_v8.xlsx</li><li>Use CHAS Trades tab to input changes and see points.
