The point where lift stops increasing is called the <em>critical angle of attack</em>, where flow separates off of the suction side of the airfoil. This phenomena is called <em>flow separation</em> or <em>stall</em>. We will go much more into this later.</p><p>For 2D airfoils below critical angle of attack, the <em>lift curve slope</em>, the slope of lift coefficient vs. angle of attack, is approximately linear.</p><p>Airplanes care much more about efficiency, as defined by <em>lift to drag ratio,</em> so they operate at low angles of attack of a few degrees in cruise. During takeoff and landings, they operate at a higher alpha, closer to critical alpha, but far enough away so that a gust of wind or a slight piloting error does not cause the plane to crash.</p><p>Though racecars also care about efficiency, the efficiency required to achieve the best on track performance is much lower. This is especially true for FSAE. Therefore, you want to operate very close the critical angle of attack, but not too close that you are sensitive to ambient conditions.</p><p><u><strong>Aerodynamic Coefficients</strong></u></p><p>Aerodynamic coefficients are aerodynamic variables normalized by <em>dynamic pressure</em>. Since aerodynamics is speed sensitive (as in higher speed results in higher forces), normalization by dynamic pressure removes the speed sensitivity, and gives you a number that is representative across all speed. Dynamic pressure is defined as:</p><p><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper confluence-embedded-manual-size"><img class="confluence-embedded-image confluence-thumbnail" draggable="false" width="75" src="attachments/259297702/259297705.png" data-image-src="attachments/259297702/259297705.png" data-unresolved-comment-count="0" data-linked-resource-id="259297705" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="attachment" data-linked-resource-default-alias="image-2023-5-8_11-7-33.png" data-base-url="https://wiki.itap.purdue.edu" data-linked-resource-content-type="image/png" data-linked-resource-container-id="259297702" data-linked-resource-container-version="6" alt=""></span></p><p>Note that there is a trap here.

It's common for cars to use front area since they are pressure drag dominated (we will go into different types of drags). For racecars, we tend to use 1 m^2 for reference area. The resulting quantity is coefficient times area. This is useful since areas are constantly changing with each iteration, and there is no real benefit since scaling changes the aerodynamics too much for the coefficient to be the same across all sizes.</p><p><u><strong>Aerodynamic Forces</strong></u></p><p>Aerodynamic forces are generated in two way, <em>pressure </em>and <em>shear</em>.</p><p><em>Pressure force</em> is the probably what you think about when you think about aerodynamic forces. Note that pressure force always acts normally into the surface. It's the difference in pressure on an object that generates a net force. In the context of a racecar, you want high pressure on top and low pressure on the bottom, so that the the net force points down. Drag force generated by difference in pressure is called pressure drag, or form drag.</p><p><em>Shear force</em> is generated by friction between the fluid and the surface of the car. Shear force is the direct results of <em>viscosity</em>, or the stickiness of the fluid. Shear force is directly proportional to wall normal velocity gradient. The higher the gradient, the higher the shear force. Unlike pressure force, shear force is always tangential to the surface. Therefore, shear force plays a very small role in lift generation, but can play a big role in drag generation. The drag generated by shear force is called skin friction drag or parasitic drag.</p><p><u><strong>Different Types of Pressures</strong></u></p><p>There are three types of pressure people usually talk about. <em>Static pressure</em>, <em>dynamic pressure</em>, and <em>total </em>(or <em>stagnation</em>) <em>pressure</em>.</p><p><em>Static pressure (P)</em> is caused by molecular collisions with the surface of an object. It is the pressure that you &quot;feel&quot;, it is the pressure that generate pressure force, it is the pressure that generates downforce and drag.</p><p><em>Dynamic pressure (q)</em>, which we have already touched on, is the additional pressure caused by motion of the fluid. </p><p>When you bring a stream of air to a stop, like when you put your hand out of the window of a driving car, you get <em>total pressure</em> (<em>stagnation pressure</em>). It is static pressure and dynamic pressure summed together. When you bring the stream of air to stagnation, all of the total pressure is in the form of static pressure since the flow is not moving. However, if you don't do anything to the moving flow, it is comprised of ambient pressure as static pressure and dynamic pressure. Total pressure is a very important concept to understand, since it represents energy in the airflow. If you lose total pressure, it means works has been done by the flow. That's why it's important to keep total pressure high, since high total pressure flow has a lot more energy and by extension the ability to do work (aka generating force).</p><p>It's time to get into rant that I should have gotten into early, and it is about classification of drag. People like to classify drag as pressure drag and skin friction drag as indicated earlier(and induced drag, but that's another topic, the rant isn't about induced drag). To some extent, this makes sense, because the drags are generated by two different types of aerodynamic forces. I personally disagree with the classification, since they are two sides of the same coin. Neither pressure drag nor skin friction drag can exist without viscosity. In other words, neither exists without skin friction. Moreover, both can be qualified by total pressure loss after freestream flow interacted with a geometry. There is nothing fundamentally different about these two different types of drags. Think about drag as total pressure loss is much more useful when it comes to design as well. If reducing drag is your goal, you know the only way to achieve it is through minimizing losses (as opposed to think about &quot;is the tradeoff of wall shear stress worth it for the increase in wake size&quot; or whatever). </p><p><u><strong>Bernoulli's Principle</strong></u></p><p><em>Bernoulli's principle</em> is a touchy subject simply because the shear number of misconceptions out there. So I think it's good to clarify it first.</p><p>For those of you who don't know, Bernoulli principles operate on the basis of conservation of total pressure (aka conservation of energy). As flow velocity increases, dynamic pressure increases, static pressure must decrease to conserve total pressure.</p><p>Now, people think Bernoulli's principle applies everywhere. This can't be further from the truth. In rotational flow (which is always the case in the real world), Bernoulli's principle only applies along a streamline. This is the case for both viscous and inviscid flow. In the real world, energy can be dissipated into entropy due to viscous effects, therefore, energy is not always conserved.</p><p>Bernoulli's principle does apply everywhere <u>if and only if</u> you make the irrotational assumption (i.e. potential flow), which we will get into in the next page. So, be really careful about how and where you are using Bernoulli. </p><p><u><strong>Governing Equation of Fluid Mechanics</strong></u></p><p>You can think about fluid mechanics in terms of <em>control volumes.</em> Control volumes are imaginary volume in space that contains geometries of interest. For example, if I am interested in a converging diverging nozzle, I can put a volume around it and analyze fluxes into and out of the control volume to calculate thrust generated by the nozzle. Control volumes are enclosed by control surfaces, and these are the surfaces that flow variable flux into and out of.</p><p><br/></p><p><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper confluence-embedded-manual-size"><img class="confluence-embedded-image confluence-thumbnail" draggable="false" height="150" src="attachments/259297702/259297760.png" data-image-src="attachments/259297702/259297760.png" data-unresolved-comment-count="0" data-linked-resource-id="259297760" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="attachment" data-linked-resource-default-alias="image-2023-5-8_15-24-31.png" data-base-url="https://wiki.itap.purdue.edu" data-linked-resource-content-type="image/png" data-linked-resource-container-id="259297702" data-linked-resource-container-version="6" alt=""></span></p><p>So what equations do I apply to the control volumes? The answer is the governing equations of fluid mechanics. Fluid mechanics is governed by 3 conservation equations: <em>continuity, momentum, and energy.</em> The equations can either be in integral or differential form. Integral form is easier to solve by hand, but CFD prefers differential form.</p><p><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper confluence-embedded-manual-size"><img class="confluence-embedded-image confluence-external-resource" draggable="false" alt="Navier-Stokes Equations" height="400" src="https://www.grc.nasa.gov/www/k-12/airplane/Images/nseqs.gif" data-image-src="https://www.grc.nasa.gov/www/k-12/airplane/Images/nseqs.gif"></span> </p><p><em>Continuity equation</em> is the mass conservation equation. Continuity equation ensures the mass flow (change in unit mass per unit time) into the control volume is equal to the mass flow out of the control volume.</p><p><em>Momentum equation</em> is the, well, the momentum conservation equation. It ensures the momentum is conserved in the control volume. Why do we care about momentum? Because force equals change in unit momentum per unit time. Momentum equation has a special name: the <em>Navier-Stoke equation</em>. </p><p><em>Energy equation</em> describes conservation of energy. Conservation of energy is of the least interest to us, since we run incompressible flow (flow density doesn't change) and don't take any temperature into account, energy equation is trivial and doesn't need to be solved. </p><p><u><strong>Fluid Particles</strong></u></p><p><em>Fluid particle</em> is a term that I will use a lot in the reset of aerodynamics fundamentals as well as CFD fundamentals, and it is important that understand this term.</p><p>As much as fluid particles sounds like air molecules, they are not. Fluid particles are much bigger. This point needs to be stressed since you cannot say a fluid particle has random motions like molecules do.</p><p>A fluid particle is a control volume small enough to resolve the physics. In other words, fluid particles are of different sizes in different problems. So in a way, fluid particles are analogous to mesh cell in CFD, if you are familiar with them.  </p><p><br/></p>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><ol><li>How close you can get to the critical angle of attack is highly dependent on the context of the problem. Is your Reynolds number varying a lot? If yes, you want to avoid running too close to critical angle of attack since laminar separation could occur. Are you running in variable condition? If yes, you want to avoid running too close to critical angle of attack to give yourself some margins. And they are plenty more examples. It is your job as an engineer to decide what's good value.</li><li>For plane, skin friction drag dominate since there is almost no separated region where flow recirculate. Cars are pressure drag dominated since there almost always is a large separated region behind the car, unless your car is designed to the break land speed record. Both types of drag are expressed as total pressure loss, that is the fundamental law of work and energy. This is the reason why I don't know separating skin friction and pressure drag.</li><li>Scaled wind tunnel model is useful if you can achieve roughly the same Reynolds number. For example, you want to study how a car performs at 40 mph but you only have access to a 3/8 scale tunnel, you need to run the tunnel at 106.7 mph to match Reynolds number and get useful data. I explained the concept of Reynolds number in a later page if you are confused by what I am talking about.</li><li>You don't need to solve the conservation equation by hand because you can't. There is a prize of 1 million dollars if you do though. When you are designing, you need to think about the physics captured by these equation (e.g. concepts like flow separation). People how studied these equation numerical and did tons of physical experiments that the physics inside the equations are somewhat understood. </li></ol></font>
