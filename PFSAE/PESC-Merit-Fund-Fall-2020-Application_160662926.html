Students utilize engineering skills and state of the art tools to manufacture and validate the new car. Our team is comprised primarily of mechanical engineering students, but we also welcome students from other majors. Purdue FSAE is first and foremost a team. Our team spends an enormous amount of time together throughout the school year which helps us work together effectively. We collaborate to find new ways to combine our wide array of engineering talents and experiences to build and design a unique race car. At the end of the school year in May, our members compete with our vehicle at the Michigan International Speedway against 100 international universities. Our goal is to excel in vehicle design and maneuverability on track with a top 10 finish in our competition. </span></span></li></ul></li><li><span style="color: rgb(32,33,36);">Amount of funding requested</span><ul><li><span style="color: rgb(32,33,36);">Amount for new dampers - $2600</span></li></ul></li><li><span style="color: rgb(32,33,36);">Is this a new expenditure/project/event: If so, please explain what your specific goals are for this activity and how you intend to achieve them. If not, please describe how successful this expenditure/project/event has been in the past and how many years you have participated in this specific activity</span><ul><li><span style="color: rgb(32,33,36);">This is a new expenditure. The team would like to purchase new dampers for our race car to serve as replacements for our current dampers. Unlike most of our vehicle, the current dampers are reused from year to year, but they have begun to leak, indicating that they should be replaced. The leak degrades the performance of our car in competition, as the dampers become less effective with the leak. The old dampers would be put on our second vehicle which is for test purposes only and not for competition.</span></li></ul></li><li><span style="color: rgb(32,33,36);">How does this expenditure/event/project contribute to your mission statement or overarching purpose of your Organization?</span><ul><li><span style="color: rgb(32,33,36);">1: New dampers will allow for better handling of our car and will improve our performance in the competition events. With the improved performance, we will place higher in the events and in the overall standings to meet our goals.</span></li><li><span style="color: rgb(32,33,36);">2: New dampers will allow the suspension geometry and the CAD models to actually correlate with the on-track performance of the Ohlin dampers. If we have to continue usage of our degrading set our mathematical models will not have the ability to account for the losses in performance and as a result, our vehicle's design and running performance will suffer. <span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);">For us to accomplish our goal of designing a car with the best possible performance, we would need new dampeners to be modeled and running at their best.</span></span></li></ul></li><li><span style="color: rgb(32,33,36);">Please specifically describe how the funding will be used for your expenditure/event/project: describe in detail the plan, date and timeline, and logistics.</span><ul><li><span style="color: rgb(32,33,36);">The funds will be used directly to purchase Ohlins TTX25 MKII dampers during the Spring 2021 semester so that the dampers can be incorporated into the vehicle for the SAE Michigan competition in May 2021.</span></li></ul></li><li><span style="color: rgb(32,33,36);">Please describe who is directly impacted by this event and how they will benefit from participating.</span><ul><li>2: The new dampers would increase the vehicle's reliability and therefore directly impact the members of Formula SAE by allowing them to design a car without being limited by the shortcomings of worn-out dampers.Â </li><li><span style="color: rgb(32,33,36);">1: The new dampers would affect the Formula SAE members through improved competition performance and vehicle reliability.</span></li></ul></li><li><span style="color: rgb(32,33,36);">If you receive funding but this event is canceled due to unforeseen circumstances, how would you utilize the extra resources?</span><ul><li><span style="color: rgb(32,33,36);">If the SAE Michigan competition is canceled the dampers would still need to be replaced because of how much they've degraded. The new dampers would still be used on our current vehicle because we are and will be continuously testing in preparation for the next competition. <br/></span></li></ul></li><li><span style="color: rgb(32,33,36);">If this is a new event or project, how do you personally plan on measuring its success and impact? If this is not a new event or project, how will you compare the success of the event to when it has been run in previous years and highlight how you plan to continue to improve this event/project.</span><ul><li>The worth of having new dampers will be measured by the large improvements in tunability and the overall performance of our vehicle</li></ul></li><li><span style="color: rgb(32,33,36);">Describe any changes that will be made to the event/project to accommodate changing conditions stemming from the new Protect Purdue guidelines.</span><ul><li><span style="color: rgb(32,33,36);">No changes needed since the only request is an expenditure. The installation of the dampers in our shop would be in accordance with the SOP guidelines in place for our shop.</span></li></ul></li><li><span style="color: rgb(32,33,36);">What other means of funding has your organization pursued specifically for this event? Are there currently funds already allocated to this event/project? If so, how much?</span><ul><li><span style="color: rgb(32,33,36);">1: We pursue sponsorships from Purdue Engineering schools as well as many companies, however, all of the costs go towards manufacturing a new vehicle and paying for competition each year. No funds have currently been allocated to purchase the dampers. <br/></span></li><li><span style="color: rgb(32,33,36);">2: Our team is funded through sponsorships from Purdue Engineering schools as well as many companies, however all of our resources are allocated to funding our registration and travel expenses, as well as, manufacturing the new vehicle. No funds have currently been allocated to replace the dampers. </span></li></ul></li><li><span style="color: rgb(32,33,36);">If you received funding last semester, please elaborate how that funding was used and the impact it had on your organization</span><ul><li><span style="color: rgb(32,33,36);">We did not receive funding last semester.</span></li></ul></li></ul>
