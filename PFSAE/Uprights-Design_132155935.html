                    <h1 id="UprightsDesign-Changesbetween2019and2020">Changes between 2019 and 2020</h1><p>The 2019 car was originally designed without a chain tensioner with the theory that if the chain slack is minimal in CAD, this would carry through onto the actual car. Due to tolerances between the chassis and drivetrain placement, the center to center distance between the front and rear sprockets was slightly farther apart than expected. A half link was added, and a chain tensioner was designed and added to the vehicle. To integrate the chain tensioning system and eliminate the risk of manufacturing tolerances affecting the chain tension, the mounting system of the 2020 uprights allows for chain tension adjustment. This works by using turnbuckles at the upper mounting points which can extend outwards or shorten depending on what is required to maintain optimal chain tension. Based of several years of using a DID 520 chain, we know that the chain stretch is, at the most, half a link, so the adjustment was designed with this quantity in mind. To account for any potential tolerances, half a link of adjustment was provided forwards while one link of adjustment was provided backwards. This way, effects of tolerances will not pose as an issue and there is sufficient chain tension adjustment for the operating time of the car.</p><p><br/></p><h1 id="UprightsDesign-UprightsCADDesign">Uprights CAD Design</h1><p><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper confluence-embedded-manual-size"><img class="confluence-embedded-image" draggable="false" width="400" src="attachments/132155935/132157445.png" data-image-src="attachments/132155935/132157445.png" data-unresolved-comment-count="0" data-linked-resource-id="132157445" data-linked-resource-version="2" data-linked-resource-type="attachment" data-linked-resource-default-alias="image2019-11-1_22-1-48.png" data-base-url="https://wiki.itap.purdue.edu" data-linked-resource-content-type="image/png" data-linked-resource-container-id="132155935" data-linked-resource-container-version="3" alt=""></span></p><p>Image of 2020 uprights design</p><p><br/></p><p>The main parameters constraining the geometry of the upright are lower tab angle and length, differential axis position, upper tab angle and length, and turnbuckle length. Using these constraints, the upright geometry can be achieved. The bearings used are determined through the inner diameter needed for the Drexler differential and the radial loads on the bearings. The size of the bolts and tabs were determined through the estimated loads on the uprights (see Uprights force model) and using structures analysis spreadsheet. This can be found inÂ Z:\2020\6_Drivetrain\Drivetrain_structures_2020.xlxs . This spreadsheet allows us to determine how to size the tabs and joints on the uprights. Because rod ends are being used in the the upper mounting points are not rigid. Any sway or rotation of the uprights would result in thrust loading on the bearings and change the load path of the upright forces. These are not desirable, so the brace aims to eliminate these issues. It is slotted to provide for adjustment for when the turnbuckles are adjusted.</p><p><br/></p><h1 id="UprightsDesign-Turnbuckles">Turnbuckles</h1><p>The turnbuckles are two Aurora XAM-3 rod ends threaded into a piece of 7055 Al hex stock. The manufactured bar may not be hex stock depending on what is available. The analysis on this can also be found in the same structures spreadsheet. The failure modes for thread shear and buckling were considered for both turnbuckles.</p>
