                    <p>If the rack being used is the Narrco, it would probably make sense to make an upright with holes further out for the Kaz rack. We hav had trouble getting hold of a narrco rack, but it is likely KAZ is reliable. Because Kaz uses ~1 inch longer steer arm, additional length and hole could be placed in tierod tab on upright with no effect on structural capability with narrco. This nearly negligible mass could save needing to make new uprights in case of switching.</p><p>NOTE: Worth reaching out to steering rack manufacturer for clearer failure criteria as brought up in 2021 Cockpit/Controls/Safety/Brakes Design.</p><p><a class="external-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FSAE/comments/exl7vn/narrco_rack/" rel="nofollow">https://www.reddit.com/r/FSAE/comments/exl7vn/narrco_rack/</a>Â </p><p><br/></p><p>Note from PF22:</p><p>We placed an order for a Narrco rack in ~Sept-Oct 2021. We received a note (after bugging them) in Jan 2022 mentioning a 6 week lead time. We ultimately decided to cancel the order due to budget and having the PF20 rack as a spare.</p><p><br/></p>
