                    <h2 id="SLAPrintingUpperIntake-WheretoPrint">Where to Print</h2><p>Typically, the entire intake is SLA 3D printed, with the plenum and runners being outsourced to our sponsors Realize Inc. This leaves the printing of the diffuser, throttle body, and trumpet to us, which is done in the 3D Printing Club's lab, ARMS B098. 3D Printing Club will be abbreviated to 3DPC.</p><p>The SLA printers in the lab are <em>Formlabs Form 2</em> printers, entry level desktop SLA printers. The resin that the 3DPC usually runs in their printers is <em>Forms Clear V4 (FLGPCL04).</em> This material was used on PF19 and there were no known issues. Information about the printer along with the material datasheets (not very comprehensive) can be found <a class="external-link" href="https://formlabs.com/3d-printers/form-3/tech-specs/" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p><h2 id="SLAPrintingUpperIntake-CADPreperation">CAD Preperation</h2><p>Typically, there isn't much as far as CAD preparation for 3D printing aside from exporting the model as a .stl file, and SLA printing is no different. The low effort nature of printing is driven by the fact that the trumpet and the throttle body, being the smaller of the 3 parts can comfortably fit within the size limits of the printer with no effort.</p><p>The issue comes from the diffuser in that its longest dimension is somewhere around 172-173mm (~6.79 in) depending on which year). This poses an issues as the Form 2 printers in 3DPC's lab have a build volume of 145 x 145 x 175 mm, leaving only leaving 2mm (0.078 in) under the Z-axis limit. Understanding why 2mm of room isn't enough takes a basic level of understanding of the SLA printing process.</p><h2 id="SLAPrintingUpperIntake-SLAPrintingProcess">SLA Printing Process</h2><p>SLA printing entails using very precise UV lasers to cure initially liquid resin into a hard plastic. Similarly to FDM printing, this happens on a layer by layer basis, building the product up from the build plate. Because the adhesion between the part and the printer plate is due to cured resin, it is usually a bit harder to remove after the fact, so hard in fact that removing the part usually (inevitably) damage and cracks some of the plastic. To get around this, the pre-processor software automatically generates a sacrificial raft to go on the bed, with a triangulated support structure that connects the base to the actual part which is suspended as some random angle in space. The connection between support and part is intentionally small so that after printing, the plastic can easily be broken to separate the part from all the sacrificial material. Below is the throttle body part printed using the pre-processor software's raft and support.</p><p><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper confluence-embedded-manual-size"><img class="confluence-embedded-image" draggable="false" height="400" src="attachments/135102986/135102993.png" data-image-src="attachments/135102986/135102993.png" data-unresolved-comment-count="0" data-linked-resource-id="135102993" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="attachment" data-linked-resource-default-alias="image2019-11-24_21-43-1.png" data-base-url="https://wiki.itap.purdue.edu" data-linked-resource-content-type="image/png" data-linked-resource-container-id="135102986" data-linked-resource-container-version="14" alt=""></span></p><h2 id="SLAPrintingUpperIntake-IssueswithPrintingtheDiffuser">Issues with Printing the Diffuser</h2><p>Obviously this automated process cannot be done within the allotted 2mm of Z direction. The below images shows the original diffuser part with the automated supports and raft generated. The blue box represents the outer profile of the part while the grey box represents the limits of the printer.</p><p><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper confluence-embedded-manual-size"><img class="confluence-embedded-image p-image_viewer__image confluence-external-resource" draggable="false" height="400" src="https://files.slack.com/files-pri/TANHYTSP3-FQWQC0RFW/image.png" data-image-src="https://files.slack.com/files-pri/TANHYTSP3-FQWQC0RFW/image.png"></span></p><p>To get around this issue, I identified where there actually needed to be support structure (the overhangs of the flange on top) and modeled in my own support structure. The support is simply a triangulated structure that connects the vertical portion of the part to the flange at a more friendly angle (not 90 deg), with each cylinder being around 0.050-0.060&quot; in diameter and with each support no more than 0.350&quot; from the nearest. If it isn't obvious, the circular pattern tool in the CAD software is useful for this.</p><p><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper confluence-embedded-manual-size"><img class="confluence-embedded-image p-image_viewer__image confluence-external-resource" draggable="false" height="400" src="https://files.slack.com/files-pri/TANHYTSP3-FQZEHNLHL/image.png" data-image-src="https://files.slack.com/files-pri/TANHYTSP3-FQZEHNLHL/image.png"></span></p><p><br/></p><p>The other issue with this part comes from the fact that its a &quot;suction cup&quot;. The concept of SLA printing involves curing initially liquid resin, which means the area of the part that is currently being manufactured is dipped into a tub of liquid and it is printed bottom to top in this manner. In other words, the bed is upside down, the part is upside down and hangs from the bed, and the area closer to the bed is printed earlier than the rest of the part. Because the lower ~0.5in of the solid needs to be submerged into the tub of resin, if the part has a concave nature, it needs to not seal air or be a closed cup. Think about what happens if you take a cup, invert it, and plunge it (or take it out) vertically in a bathtub. With that said, the lower portion of the printed part needs to have an opening to allow air to displace, unfortunately, the air intake diffuser does not have any holes it in.</p><p><br/></p><p>To combat this issue, I created an array of small extrusions on the surface contacting the bed. This will support the part off the bed, while allowing air to displace in and out while the part gets dipped and pulled out of the resin tub over and over again. Keep in mind that after adding the small blocks, the entire part still needs to fit under the Z limit of 175mm. That looked like this:</p><p><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper confluence-embedded-manual-size"><img class="confluence-embedded-image shrinkToFit transparent confluence-external-resource" draggable="false" height="400" src="https://files.slack.com/files-pri/TANHYTSP3-FQX8EDRUY/image.png" data-image-src="https://files.slack.com/files-pri/TANHYTSP3-FQX8EDRUY/image.png"></span></p><p>The blocks were small enough that they could be snipped off and sanded smooth, and the spacing between them was driven by the fact that material cannot be bridged over a large gap for printing.</p><p><br/></p><h2 id="SLAPrintingUpperIntake-LessonsLearnedinAttempt1ofPrintingPF20Intake">Lessons Learned in Attempt 1 of Printing PF20 Intake</h2><p>There were not enough supports on the large flange, nor was there enough on the base. This causes the gap that the printer has to &quot;bridge&quot; to become too large. In the best case, this leaves a rough surface finish. In the worst case (see image below) the material there just can't cure and attach to the part, leaving nasty gaps and simply a lack of material in that overhanging/bridged region.</p><p><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper confluence-embedded-manual-size"><img class="confluence-embedded-image p-image_viewer__image confluence-external-resource" draggable="false" height="400" src="https://files.slack.com/files-pri/TANHYTSP3-FQXB3SX5F/img_20191201_130953.jpg" data-image-src="https://files.slack.com/files-pri/TANHYTSP3-FQXB3SX5F/img_20191201_130953.jpg"></span>   <span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper confluence-embedded-manual-size"><img class="confluence-embedded-image p-image_viewer__image confluence-external-resource" draggable="false" height="400" src="https://files.slack.com/files-pri/TANHYTSP3-FR59CDU05/img_20191201_130940.jpg" data-image-src="https://files.slack.com/files-pri/TANHYTSP3-FR59CDU05/img_20191201_130940.jpg"></span></p><p>The solution to this is to add more supports, closer together. In addition, I have added chamfers to the edge where the support meets the flange to decrease the distance that material needs to span.</p><p><br/></p><p><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper confluence-embedded-manual-size"><img class="confluence-embedded-image" draggable="false" height="400" src="attachments/135102986/135104099.png" data-image-src="attachments/135102986/135104099.png" data-unresolved-comment-count="0" data-linked-resource-id="135104099" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="attachment" data-linked-resource-default-alias="image2019-12-3_11-7-6.png" data-base-url="https://wiki.itap.purdue.edu" data-linked-resource-content-type="image/png" data-linked-resource-container-id="135102986" data-linked-resource-container-version="14" alt=""></span>         <span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper confluence-embedded-manual-size"><img class="confluence-embedded-image" draggable="false" height="400" src="attachments/135102986/135104107.png" data-image-src="attachments/135102986/135104107.png" data-unresolved-comment-count="0" data-linked-resource-id="135104107" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="attachment" data-linked-resource-default-alias="image2019-12-3_11-29-55.png" data-base-url="https://wiki.itap.purdue.edu" data-linked-resource-content-type="image/png" data-linked-resource-container-id="135102986" data-linked-resource-container-version="14" alt=""></span></p><ul style="list-style-type: square;"><li>Circular Pattern: 60 instances (360/60 deg pitch)    </li><li>Rectangular Pattern: 13 instances in each direction, 0.090&quot; squares with 0.090&quot; between spaces<ul style="list-style-type: square;"><li>Be sure the delete or move the bodies that interfere with the center O-ring lip </li></ul></li><li>Center Ring Supports: 0.030&quot; in diam, patterned with 30 instances (360/30 deg pitch)</li></ul><p><br/></p><p>MORE AND SMALLER BLOCKS ON BASE</p><p><br/></p><h2 id="SLAPrintingUpperIntake-LessonsLearnedinAttempt2ofPrintingPF20Intake-FinalResult">Lessons Learned in Attempt 2 of Printing PF20 Intake - Final Result</h2><p>After the changes listed above were made, the print turned out fine. The surface finish on the overhanging side of the flange still isn't perfect, the structure is there and that's what's important. A flange like that is going to be inherently difficult to have a decent finish on.</p><p>Although the pattern on the bed allows for air to displace into and out of the part as its dipped into the resin over and over, the suction issue still takes place in another manner. As the print gets to the final major flange, the part still like to get stuck to the bed. This is because there is suction holding it down purely because the shear area of the material being printed, not because air cannot travel into the cavity. Unfortunately, this is unavoidable with the nature of this part. There was one occasion where the Z-axis motor of the printer simply couldn't overcome that for and the printer displayed an error message. Luckily, you can tell the printer to ignore the message and continue. It doesn't sound all that pleasant as you can hear the machine struggling to lift after each layer, but it does get the job done.</p><p>Below are some pictures of the PF20 diffuser after printing and after the IPA bath.</p><p><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper confluence-embedded-manual-size"><img class="confluence-embedded-image p-image_viewer__image confluence-external-resource" draggable="false" height="400" src="https://files.slack.com/files-pri/TANHYTSP3-FR1QS53GS/img_20191207_232845.jpg" data-image-src="https://files.slack.com/files-pri/TANHYTSP3-FR1QS53GS/img_20191207_232845.jpg"></span><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper confluence-embedded-manual-size"><img class="confluence-embedded-image p-image_viewer__image confluence-external-resource" draggable="false" height="400" src="https://files.slack.com/files-pri/TANHYTSP3-FRGNZQDSS/img_20191207_232857.jpg" data-image-src="https://files.slack.com/files-pri/TANHYTSP3-FRGNZQDSS/img_20191207_232857.jpg"></span></p><p><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper confluence-embedded-manual-size"><img class="confluence-embedded-image p-image_viewer__image confluence-external-resource" draggable="false" height="400" src="https://files.slack.com/files-pri/TANHYTSP3-FREGUVB88/img_20191207_233051.jpg" data-image-src="https://files.slack.com/files-pri/TANHYTSP3-FREGUVB88/img_20191207_233051.jpg"></span><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper confluence-embedded-manual-size"><img class="confluence-embedded-image p-image_viewer__image confluence-external-resource" draggable="false" height="400" src="https://files.slack.com/files-pri/TANHYTSP3-FREGUQUM6/img_20191208_091308.jpg" data-image-src="https://files.slack.com/files-pri/TANHYTSP3-FREGUQUM6/img_20191208_091308.jpg"></span><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper confluence-embedded-manual-size"><img class="confluence-embedded-image p-image_viewer__image confluence-external-resource" draggable="false" height="400" src="https://files.slack.com/files-pri/TANHYTSP3-FRGNZKQSJ/img_20191208_091411.jpg" data-image-src="https://files.slack.com/files-pri/TANHYTSP3-FRGNZKQSJ/img_20191208_091411.jpg"></span></p><p><br/></p><h2 id="SLAPrintingUpperIntake-AndSomePhotosofthePF19DiffuserPrint">And Some Photos of the PF19 Diffuser Print</h2><p><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper confluence-embedded-manual-size"><img class="confluence-embedded-image p-image_viewer__image confluence-external-resource" draggable="false" height="400" src="https://files.slack.com/files-pri/TANHYTSP3-FQZ0D5ADC/image.png" data-image-src="https://files.slack.com/files-pri/TANHYTSP3-FQZ0D5ADC/image.png"></span></p><p><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper confluence-embedded-manual-size"><img class="confluence-embedded-image p-image_viewer__image confluence-external-resource" draggable="false" height="400" src="https://files.slack.com/files-pri/TANHYTSP3-FQK9XKCNP/image.png" data-image-src="https://files.slack.com/files-pri/TANHYTSP3-FQK9XKCNP/image.png"></span></p><p><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper confluence-embedded-manual-size"><img class="confluence-embedded-image p-image_viewer__image confluence-external-resource" draggable="false" height="400" src="https://files.slack.com/files-pri/TANHYTSP3-FQYKJCS79/image.png" data-image-src="https://files.slack.com/files-pri/TANHYTSP3-FQYKJCS79/image.png"></span></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p>
