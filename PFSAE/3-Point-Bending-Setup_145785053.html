                    <p style="text-align: left;" align="center">The 3-Point Bending test is a test required by the SAE rules to prove that a composite sandwich panel is equivalent to the steel tubes it replaces in a space frame. The main purpose of the 3-Point Bending test is to input the failure force and displacement data to obtain the stiffness of the panel, the Youngâ€™s Modulus of the panel, and the ultimate tensile strength of the panel. This document will explain the procedures to follow for a successful 3-Point Bending test.</p><p>To begin with, the composite panels must be rectangular with dimensions 500 x 275 mm as of the 2020 Rules. This dimension might change in the future so make sure you double check the most up-to-date rule book. Moreover, the composite panel must have flat edges, and no carbon must be sticking out of the edges as shown in Figure 1, below.</p><p><br/></p><p><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper image-center-wrapper confluence-embedded-manual-size"><img class="confluence-embedded-image image-center" draggable="false" height="201" src="attachments/145785053/146768083.png" data-image-src="attachments/145785053/146768083.png" data-unresolved-comment-count="0" data-linked-resource-id="146768083" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="attachment" data-linked-resource-default-alias="image2020-4-27_16-14-52.png" data-base-url="https://wiki.itap.purdue.edu" data-linked-resource-content-type="image/png" data-linked-resource-container-id="145785053" data-linked-resource-container-version="2" alt=""></span></p><p align="center">Figure 1. Water-jetted Sandwich Panel</p><p>As you can see in Figure 1, the composite panel was water-jetted such that the edges did not have any excess material hanging off. Once you have your panel ready, the next step would be to book a time to test your panel in the Civil building lab. The Civil building Lab is in HAMP G150, however, you cannot enter without permission. You should contact the lab manager. As of 2020, the lab manager was Robert Hershberger (<a class="external-link" href="mailto:rhershb@purdue.edu" rel="nofollow">rhershb@purdue.edu</a>). Make sure you check if the same person oversees the Civil lab, if the person has changed, then update the previously mentioned name and email address. Make sure you mention the club you are working for, and the machine you want to use. The machine used for the 3-Point Bending test is an MTS.</p><p>After having set up a time, you must now install the composite panel on the fixture shown in Figure 2, below, and place the metal rod at the center of the panel. The SAE rules require that the span length of the panel is 400 mm, therefore, it is important to make sure that 50 mm of the panel sits on both ends of the support fixture. The metallic rod has a 4 in diameter, which is specified by rules as of 2020, the flat surface of the rod is meant for the MTS plate to have a flat surface to sit on. Make sure that the metal rod is centered on the panel and that it overhangs both ends of the composite panel. It is recommended to bring a protractor or a device to measure the angle of the metal rod with the panel edges to make sure that they are perpendicular to each other.</p><p><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper image-center-wrapper"><img class="confluence-embedded-image image-center" draggable="false" src="attachments/145785053/146768084.png" data-image-src="attachments/145785053/146768084.png" data-unresolved-comment-count="0" data-linked-resource-id="146768084" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="attachment" data-linked-resource-default-alias="image2020-4-27_16-15-10.png" data-base-url="https://wiki.itap.purdue.edu" data-linked-resource-content-type="image/png" data-linked-resource-container-id="145785053" data-linked-resource-container-version="2" alt=""></span></p><p align="center">Figure 2. The 3-Point Bending setup</p><p>Once the setup is ready, take a picture with some form of measurement so that the judges that check your SES document can make sure that your setup is dimensioned according to the rules. During the test, a panel is expected to deflect anywhere between 10 to 20 mm for a half inch core panel, and 5 to 9 mm for a one-inch core panel. Therefore, consider selecting an appropriate speed for the MTS such that the panel is not crushed rapidly. For past tests, the speed used was usually a feed rate of 2 mm/min to 2.5 mm/min. It would not be recommended to use a faster feed rate. Once the panel fails, it should make a loud noise, and the force vs displacement curve should suddenly drop. Keep recording the displacement curve for a few more seconds as it cuts off the last few data points before it is stopped. It is important to write down the layup schedule on the panel itself and the failure mode using a marker as it is possible to forget such information in the future. Also make note of the layup schedule you took a picture of.</p>
