                    <h2 id="Task1DecideFuelTankSize-Whyisfueltanksizesoimportant?">Why is fuel tank size so important?</h2><p>Simply put, without fuel the engine can't run. The primary reason we need to size our fuel tank using data is so that we have enough fuel to finish the endurance event of competition. This is the most important event in competition as it is worth far more points than any of the other events. We also don't want to size our fuel tank to be too big. If the fuel tank is much larger than required, we are adding unnecessary weight to our car. When designing the car, we need to make everything as light as possible. Weight adds up with each component on the car, so each system should be designed with weight management in mind. This will not be a design requirement in this onboarding, but should be something to keep in mind while designing your system.</p><h2 id="Task1DecideFuelTankSize-Usingi2tofindthefuelused">Using i2 to find the fuel used</h2><p>Below is the data file containing data from the 2021 FSAE Michigan endurance event. Download this and put it somewhere that you can access.</p><p><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper"><a class="confluence-embedded-file" href="/download/attachments/192187362/MichiganEndurance2021.ld?version=1&amp;modificationDate=1633995166000&amp;api=v2" data-nice-type="null" data-file-src="/download/attachments/192187362/MichiganEndurance2021.ld?version=1&amp;modificationDate=1633995166000&amp;api=v2" data-linked-resource-id="192189498" data-linked-resource-type="attachment" data-linked-resource-container-id="192187362" data-linked-resource-default-alias="MichiganEndurance2021.ld" data-mime-type="application/octet-stream" data-has-thumbnail="false" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-can-edit="true" aria-label="MichiganEndurance2021.ld" draggable="false"><img src="download/resources/com.atlassian.confluence.plugins.confluence-view-file-macro:view-file-macro-resources/images/placeholder-medium-file.png" height="250" alt="" draggable="false"/><span class="title">MichiganEndurance2021.ld</span></a><span class="companion-edit-button-placeholder edit-button-overlay" data-linked-resource-container-id="192187362" data-linked-resource-id="192189498" data-template-name="companionEditIcon" data-source-location="embedded-attachment"></span></span></p><p><br/></p><p>If you are unfamiliar with i2, it is the software that we use to access and look at data that was pulled off the ECU after the car was running. First thing we need to do is set up and navigate i2. To start out, open i2 and click where it says circuit. This is just one of the default workspaces that i2 comes with. Don't worry about this, we have our own workspace that we use that I will link to later. Just use this one for now. You are now in the main i2 layout. This is where you will be able to look at and analyze all the data from running the car. In order to look at data in this layout, you need to add a channel using the channel tab on the left size of the screen. Knowing this, you can figure out what channel to find that will tell you how much fuel was consumed during the endurance run.</p><h2 id="Task1DecideFuelTankSize-FinalizingTankSize">Finalizing Tank Size</h2><p>The amount of fuel used during an endurance can change from run to run. There are a number of variables that affect this, including track design and engine operating conditions. This is why we need to apply a safety factor to our fuel tank size before we start our design. Once you have chosen and applied a safety factor to your size, prepare a small paragraph that explains what you did to select your tank size and why you did it.</p>
