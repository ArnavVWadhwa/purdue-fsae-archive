                    <p>The basic concept of this process is pretty straight forward, but this is a relatively high risk activity. So here are some pointers for doing this.</p><p><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper confluence-embedded-manual-size"><img class="confluence-embedded-image" draggable="false" height="400" src="attachments/202278526/202278961.png" data-image-src="attachments/202278526/202278961.png" data-unresolved-comment-count="0" data-linked-resource-id="202278961" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="attachment" data-linked-resource-default-alias="image2022-1-10_21-28-36.png" data-base-url="https://wiki.itap.purdue.edu" data-linked-resource-content-type="image/png" data-linked-resource-container-id="202278526" data-linked-resource-container-version="9" alt=""></span></p><h3 id="BearingintoUprights-Goal">Goal</h3><p>To bore out the bearing holes to 0.001&quot;-0.0015&quot; smaller than the bearing size.</p><h3 id="BearingintoUprights-Setup">Setup</h3><p>Use toe clamps to set this up directly on the mill table. Ensure the table is clean and everything is burr-free so the uprights sits flat on the table. It helps a lot to clamp over a part of the upright that contacts the table. If the clamp contacts an area of the upright that overhangs it could bend the upright resulting in boring holes that are out of round. The photo below shows toe clamps oriented correctly according to this standard, while the photo above shows the toe clamp on the Right in the not &quot;ideal&quot; location.</p><p>Use dial indicator to find a center. It is not unexpected for the bearing hole (cut by CNC mill) to be ~0.005&quot;-0.010&quot; thou out of round. Despite that, try to find the center anyway so the final hole is as close to design intent as possible.</p><p>Find the shortest, largest diam boring bar possible. This will minimize tool deflection and make hitting a target diameter much easier. Have shop staff check your tool rake as that will impact finish quality, chatter, etc.</p><p><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper confluence-embedded-manual-size"><img class="confluence-embedded-image" draggable="false" height="250" src="attachments/202278526/202279424.png" data-image-src="attachments/202278526/202279424.png" data-unresolved-comment-count="0" data-linked-resource-id="202279424" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="attachment" data-linked-resource-default-alias="image2022-1-11_19-41-35.png" data-base-url="https://wiki.itap.purdue.edu" data-linked-resource-content-type="image/png" data-linked-resource-container-id="202278526" data-linked-resource-container-version="9" alt=""></span></p><h3 id="BearingintoUprights-BoringBar">Boring Bar</h3><p>Start with a light initial pass, chances are the bar will only cut one section of the circle on the first pass or two, that is ok. Advance the boring bar by 0.010&quot;-0.020&quot; each time, chances are 0.020&quot; will be too much and cause chatter.</p><p>Use the 0.100&quot; of cutting to get a &quot;feel&quot; for the pattern (ie does advancing the boring head by 0.005&quot; actually result in 0.005&quot; change in diam). This is important for when you get close to the final target diam.</p><p>If you're cutting the first side of an upright. Also take a pass in the middle bore with the same setup. This offers a good place to indicate after flipping for the opposite side bore.</p><p><br/></p><h3 id="BearingintoUprights-PressingBearings">Pressing Bearings</h3><p>Use the arbor press across the hall from the machine shop. Place the upright on a flat piece of aluminum (a fixture block works well) and a small 2x4 block on the bearing. Make sure everything is centered to each other so we are applying the center of pressure at the center of the bearing. Do your best to align the bearing to be coaxial with the bearing hole, although it seems like minor misalignment corrects itself pretty easily. Very slowly start pressing. If you got the interference right, you should should be able to press it in with your hand pulling at no more than halfway up that lever arm</p><p><br/></p><h3 id="BearingintoUprights-Othertipsforsuccess">Other tips for success</h3><p>Use the same micrometer to measure bearing and upright.</p><p>Measure each bearing and match to holes, OD could vary from bearing to bearing.</p><p>Avoid holding micrometer and bearing for too long, heating it up could vary measurements.</p><p>If you need less than a 0.001&quot; diam difference, do NOT advance the boring head and take a pass. Do a spring pass and that could enlarge the upright hole by up to 0.0008&quot;.</p><p>When you are approaching the target diam, it is imperative for you to know how much you are taking out. Some notes on this:</p><ul style="list-style-type: square;"><li>Free (or spring) passes can take off more than you think. If you are trying to take off less than 0.001&quot;, don't advance the tool, just take another pass at the same place. Otherwise you risk overshooting and losing the press fit.</li><li>Some cutting fluid (tap magic) should be used when taking large passes 0.010&quot; and greater. But cutting fluid can also impact the cut depth at small passes. If you are trying to take off less material with a pass, do NOT use cutting fluid.</li></ul><p><br/></p>
