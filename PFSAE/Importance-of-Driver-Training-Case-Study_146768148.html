                    <p>In 2018, we had Brad Sikorsky as one of our drivers. He was working a pro racing career while he was on the team and had experience in skip barber cars, spec miata, etc.</p><p>The question becomes how many points was that level of driving worth. To look at this, we consider the difference in his and our other endurance driver's results from 2018</p><p>Brad went 6.5% faster in endurance in terms of average and fastest lap. So i've done the math with a 3.25% slower endurance and 6.5% slower best autocross to work out the difference in points. (AutoX scores cannot be compared because they were in very different track conditions)</p><p>It comes out to be ~45 points at most (i probably over-counted efficiency points because i didn't want to do math). This would have dropped us from 14th to 20th.</p><p><br/></p><p>Takeways:</p><ul><li>A great driver with previous experience is very helpful, but not necessary for solid results. We got 14th despite being 59th in accel that year, so a solid accel result could have made up ~30 of those points. We also did abysmally in all static events that year (you're welcome). In other words, even with no better drivers than 2018, top 15 is achievable with our current car by having traction control working (for accel event) and putting up respectable numbers in design and business.</li><li>But driver training is worth a ton of points. I suspect that more driver training could get a driver closer to where Brad was than where Brett (the second endurance driver) was. It's worth more than 40 lbm, the whole aero package, drs, active aero, launch control, etc. So if the driver training time isn't there, you gotta cut scope and get testing.</li></ul><p><br/></p><p>Spreadsheet:</p><p><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper"><a class="confluence-embedded-file" href="/download/attachments/146768148/2018_driver_study_v1.xlsx?version=1&amp;modificationDate=1588041925000&amp;api=v2" data-nice-type="Excel Spreadsheet" data-file-src="/download/attachments/146768148/2018_driver_study_v1.xlsx?version=1&amp;modificationDate=1588041925000&amp;api=v2" data-linked-resource-id="146768153" data-linked-resource-type="attachment" data-linked-resource-container-id="146768148" data-linked-resource-default-alias="2018_driver_study_v1.xlsx" data-mime-type="application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet" data-has-thumbnail="true" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-can-edit="true" aria-label="2018_driver_study_v1.xlsx" draggable="false"><img src="rest/documentConversion/latest/conversion/thumbnail/146768153/1" height="250" alt="" draggable="false"/></a><span class="companion-edit-button-placeholder edit-button-overlay" data-linked-resource-container-id="146768148" data-linked-resource-id="146768153" data-template-name="companionEditIcon" data-source-location="embedded-attachment"></span></span></p><p><br/></p><p><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper"><img class="confluence-embedded-image" draggable="false" src="attachments/146768148/146768152.png" data-image-src="attachments/146768148/146768152.png" data-unresolved-comment-count="0" data-linked-resource-id="146768152" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="attachment" data-linked-resource-default-alias="image2020-4-27_22-37-23.png" data-base-url="https://wiki.itap.purdue.edu" data-linked-resource-content-type="image/png" data-linked-resource-container-id="146768148" data-linked-resource-container-version="1" alt=""></span></p>
