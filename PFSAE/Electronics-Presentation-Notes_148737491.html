And how do they integrate with each other( and how does electronics facilitate this)? </li></ul><p> </p><p>From Michael:</p><p> </p><p>What I brought:</p><p style="margin-left: 0.375in;">I believe that my presentation was more biased towards proving the basics- this is largely motivated by the 2018 Design event where the judge was focused on specifically the harness design and routing. There is a bit more high level stuff on describing how our subsystem works, but there could be a lot more. part of this was to cut down on presentation length, as i have a tendency to go way too long on details. you could also argue that the presentation could have better laid out or structured, and i would mostly agree.</p><p> </p><p>feedback from judges</p><p style="margin-left: 0.375in;">- focus on the details</p><p style="margin-left: 0.375in;">- if we've checked the box for good materials and connectors, then just focus on the other stuff</p><p style="margin-left: 0.375in;">- look at more systems integration stuff rather than electronics minutiae (again, once basic is out of the way just focus on the big stuff)</p><p style="margin-left: 0.75in;">-&gt; also prepare for systems integration, not just electronics</p><p style="margin-left: 0.375in;">- off the shelf is great, but what did i add. try to focus on what i added to the system</p><p style="margin-left: 0.75in;">-&gt; if developed something from scratch, can demonstrate that knowledge</p><p style="margin-left: 0.75in;">-&gt; if using prebuilt or legacy, need to show what i added</p><p> </p><p>Post Design Thoughts</p><p style="margin-left: 0.375in;">To be completely honest, it was pretty bad. it was less about getting shafted by the judge and more lacking the answers on my part when probed by the judge. i believe that this is the result of a couple of factors: by setting the expectation that we're aiming for design finals, he was looking for proof of much more higher level design than i provided. secondly, there was the subject of system integration that i couldn't address because i hadn't prepared for it at all. you could argue that it was out of my scope, but that doens't really fly when you're in front of the judge and telling him that you're the systems guy.</p><p>What should we do?</p><p style="margin-left: 0.375in;">At least for electronics, it probably makes sense to still prepare the proof for the basics but expect it to be glossed over. figure out what's meant by higher level- maybe i should have focused on things like the behavior of certain modules, why i included them, and then how they were utilized in the context of the overall functionality. assuming that you've done the work, make sure you can answer why it's the way it is.</p><p style="margin-left: 0.375in;">Alongside this, we should either explore the systems integration part from the perspective of the whole car, getting the chief engineer to do that, or make it its own role. given the historic limit of humans on the team, it would be best to combine it with another role. there's pros and cons for packaging it with electronics TL or chief; on one hand, the chief would be in the best position to do so as he has to take every subsystem into acount already. on the other hand, we're constantly finding that electronics honestly needs to play a bigger role in following other subsystems and figuring out how we can best serve the car. i'm not sure how it would be best to embed our subsystem into the others, but maybe explore assigning individual ELE members to join other subteams or interview other members (definitely not setting up a spy network for a hostile takeover of the team). the alternative is probably interrogating other TLs, but this is limited to you as another TL and the time everyone has for anything. actually, maybe try a mixture of both- there are certain things that only come up in convos involving two dedicated members, but it might help to let our liason ponder about the possibilities. plus, it would help solve the problem of limited inter-team relation building between ELE and the other subteams.</p><p style="margin-left: 0.375in;">Other ideas include more data tracking and tracing (through I2 pro- examine and process historic data to see trends over time? better data analysis?), as well as maybe showing more team data usage cases. might be worth a shot to also cover team structure and organization, data base and knowledge, but i feel that this starts to step away from car design and toward more organization building, which is not really the focus of the design event</p>
