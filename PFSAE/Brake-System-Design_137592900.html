The GP200 can be had with one of two pad compounds: the composite metallic compound and the blue compound. The blue compound is for aluminum discs. Aluminum is not reasonable to run as extremely good understanding of brake system temperatures would be needed to avoid structural failure due to heating. Testing performed here (<a href="129009858.html">9/14/2019 Grissom - Brake Temperature Function Testing</a>) indicates that brake temperatures went above 900 F in the front, which would essentially melt aluminum. This leaves the composite metallic compound, which is for stainless steel or titanium brake discs. (This page from wilwood contains compound information: <a class="external-link" href="https://www.wilwood.com/PDF/Flyers/fl227.pdf" rel="nofollow">https://www.wilwood.com/PDF/Flyers/fl227.pdf</a>). Our usual manufacturing method requires that the discs be magnetic. We machine the discs out from sheet, then get it surface ground by the research machine shop in discovery park. Surface grinding requires a magnetic material to hold the part, so Titanium is out. This leaves stainless steel, specifically, a magnetic stainless steel. Magnetic stainless steels are 400 series stainless steel. From here, the primary concerns are hardness and strength. Strength is the more important of the two requirements. Analysis shows that a yield strength of greater than 55 ksi is required to hold full factors on a 75 mph braking case. We can make no claim that the 1018 steel discs used in the past would hold up to this loading. So we must use the as analyzed values. This forces either a fancy material in an annealed state such as 440c or a hardenable material such as 410 stainless. Hardening is unlikely to be effective because the brake temperatures are high enough to where the heat treat is going to changed in mysterious ways. So this leaves 440c stainless. That is probably the right way to go about this, but the wrong way that might work is just to get 1018 like we did in the past that has a yield of 60 ksi, or a 4130 with yield of 70 ksi. The trick here is that the temperature penalty is higher for a low carbon steel than for stainless. At 900 F, the low carbon steel is going to yield at ~40% of the original value, while the stainless should be at ~70%. </p><p><br/></p><p>This paper has data for coefficient of friction vs temperature for 17-4ph, cast iron, and 4130. 4130 had consistent, but low friction coefficient. This is likely acceptable however.</p><p>It also has pressure capability of wilwood gp200 and tilton 78 master cylinder...</p><p><a class="external-link" href="https://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/119947/1080312700-MIT.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y" rel="nofollow">https://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/119947/1080312700-MIT.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y</a></p><p><br/></p><p>So probably run 4130 normalized sheet as this increase strength and will still provide adequate friction relative to 1018. 440c stainless would be better, but costs ~$1000 vs ~$200 before including needing to buy carbide end mills.</p>
