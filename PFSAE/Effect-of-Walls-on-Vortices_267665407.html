                    <p><u><strong>Imaging</strong></u></p><p>When a vortex is close to a wall, it tends to move along the wall in the tangential velocity direction of the point of the vortex closet to the said wall. This effect is called imaging, and it can explained by the same way one could explain ground effect.</p><p>In order to maintain the (slip) wall boundary condition (talking inviscid here), the wall can be seen as a symmetry plane, where is all the flow structures is mirrored to the other side. This way, normal component of velocity to the wall is canceled out by symmetry. Due to the existence of the mirroring vortex, the shear stress on the side closing to the wall is reduced to 0, leading to overall shear force component to be in the direction of velocity closest to the wall. </p><p><u><strong>Scrub</strong></u></p><p>Near the wall around a vortex, one side experiences upwash and the other side experiences downwash. While the downwashing side is useful in suppressing any separation on the wall, the upwashing side does the opposite. If the vortex is strong enough, it can lead to separation on a flat plate at 0 or even negative angle of attack. The losses created by the upwash and the separation is called scrub. Scrub can be created on any walls, including the ground and the bodywork. </p><p>Sometimes, scrub can be so strong that a contra-rotating vortex is rolled up. In that case, the original vortex will get upwashed and sidewashed away from the countra-rotation, which may or may not be desirable. </p>
