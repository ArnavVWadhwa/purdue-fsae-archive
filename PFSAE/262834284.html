                    <h3 id="Harness:RapidHarness-Background:"><strong>Background:</strong></h3><p>Harness CAD is an immensely useful tool for designing a harness. Not only does it offer wonderful tools for keeping track of every component to be purchased or used within the harness but it is also invaluable when it comes to visualizing the technical aspects of the harness. Normal CAD simply does not capture the complexity of individual wires, splices, loop lengths, etc. and things will be missed if that is the only tool used.</p><h3 id="Harness:RapidHarness-Tutorial:"><strong>Tutorial:</strong></h3><p>This video walks through the basics of RapidHarness use, but does not cover team practices.</p><p><iframe class="youtube-player" type="text/html" style="width: 400px; height: 300px"

</p><h3 id="Harness:RapidHarness-Tips:"><strong>Tips:</strong></h3><ul><li>Version everything so that it can be used and referenced by anyone on the team</li><li>Leave adding wire gauge and color until wire lengths are finalized, it is difficult to keep track of them once they are declared</li><li>Use previous harness' layout and re-bundle it based on the new routing instead of creating a new one</li><li>Connector designs can be changed quite easily</li><li>At the end check that no wires are doubling back on themselves unintentionally, this can sometimes happen inadvertently when adjusting bundles</li><li>Many sensors will have some length of wire between them and their connector, the harness length should be reduced by this amount if possible to avoid unnecessarily long connections</li><li>Wait to add wire lengths until after CAD is frozen, it is difficult to change them after the fact if accounting for sensor wire lead lengths</li></ul><h3 id="Harness:RapidHarness-Timeline:"><strong>Timeline:</strong></h3><ul style=""><li>Summer → Preliminary harness CAD created</li><li>Design Season → Edit preliminary harness CAD based on team changes as much as possible</li><li>Post Main CAD Freeze → Finalize remaining items such as wire lengths, AWG, color, etc.</li></ul>
