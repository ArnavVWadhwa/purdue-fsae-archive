                    <p><u><strong>Design</strong></u></p><ul><li>Do not simply run yaw 15 and yaw 0, build a simplistic aero map from time to time to make sure your package is insensitive</li><li>Designing for yaw 15 limits overall performance, try to design for yaw 0 and de-sensitize to yaw 15</li><li>Car with higher weight pitches more, take that into consideration when setting ride height minima</li><li>5% aero adjustment in each direction is not enough, have more</li><li>If you want to do electrical DRS, motors for RC crawlers with titanium gears are a really good choice. NC state was able to achieve 10 ms actuation time with those</li><li>With aero maps, you can calculated weighted CL and CD based on the amount of time car spends in the regime and how important the regime is. A good weighted CL and CD can be a good one value representation of the performance of aero package</li><li>Different design deadline for aero, maybe per part deadline</li></ul><p><u><strong>Manufacturing</strong></u></p><ul><li>Groups working on different parts to make manufacturing go faster</li><li>Manufacturing lead in addition to team lead to increase speed and reduce load for team lead</li><li>More mold machining sponsors for better scheduling</li><li>Keep good relationship with BIDC</li></ul><p><u><strong>Design Event</strong></u></p><ul><li>Have CFD plots ready at hand. I got asked something as simple as showing a CFD picture of pressure distribution around the wing</li><li>Try very very very hard for wind tunnels. Half of the design event was about CFD validation</li><li>Always prepare for skidpad radius aero vs. non aero question</li></ul><p><u><strong>Validation</strong></u></p><ul><li>Wind tunnel<ul><li>Ride height setting<ul><li>Triple check the ride height you run in CFD is reachable in real life</li><li>Using ride height datums isn't the best ideas since there is a lot of going back and forth. Do practice runs and figure out the rod end length</li></ul></li><li>Tufts vs. Flow Viz<ul><li>Separation shows up much better with flow viz than tufts</li><li>Flow viz recipe to try:<ul><li>1 liter of paraffin or diesel oil</li><li>Add TiO2. Enough to make a thin slurry that's in between paraffin and lubricating oil in consistency</li><li>Add half a teaspoonful of fluorescein color indicator </li><li>Add a few drops of oleic acid or linseed oil as wetting agent to allow flow viz to flow better</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Figure out if the car can be lifted up when mounted and adjust test plans accordingly</li><li>Practice practice practice<ul><li>Practice every change</li><li>When making the test plan, consult what actually can be done quickly on the car </li></ul></li></ul></li><li>On track<ul><li>Rolling resistance is nonlinear with speed. Unless you can figure out the nonlinearity, coast down is useless in practice (maybe good for design)</li><li>Don't do 70 mph for high speed steady state since the car can't stay at that speed fast enough for the downforce to reach steady state</li></ul></li></ul><p><br/></p>
