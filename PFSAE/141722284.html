Or “why are you telling me this” test.</p><p>                                             iii.     Suspension – instead of “minimal time was spent on kinematics, the lapsim model was used to run sensitivity analysis and determine that kinematic improvements were not the largest factor in improving track time.  Instead, the lapsim revealed that structural changes posed greater opportunity and therefore became the focus for this year’s design.</p><p>                                             iv.     Highlight creativity/innovation small and large.  How did you accomplish all requirements (weight, stiffness, functionality) in a clever way?</p><p>                                              v.     How do systems integrate?  What are trade-offs/impacts of one system to meet the requirements of another and why?</p><p>                                             vi.     Aero – if front biased was ideal, why was it designed to 50/50?</p>
