Alternatively, we can try to map out voltage VS battery capacity and try to estimate it</li></ul></li><li>Gear Shifter<ul><li>Might be a tad on the complex side- have to make sure that the Teensy can reliably read the encoder data and transmit the data properly</li><li>running motor through ECU vs Motor Controller- Mike Reising (Electronics TL, Chief) suggested to use an external motor controller in the past, so Troy would prefer that one be used. Personally I think it depends on motor size- for smaller motors like the Neverest 60 we were originally using, running it through the ECU would be alright since the ECU will be able to handle it. Something else that needs to be considered is the difficulty of integrating an external motor controller with the M130.</li></ul></li><li>CAN I/O Expander<ul><li>no comment</li></ul></li></ul><h1 id="id-10/12/2019AlumniDesignReviewatPreliminaryDesignDeadline-Aero">Aero</h1><p>Just going to go slide by slide and put my notes/what I was saying for each one. Raunaq should probably comment on the CFD slides since I don't understand this area as well as he does.</p><p>Lessons Learned/Goals - Both of these lead to us focusing more on the non-CFD analysis and manufacturing of the package. Reducing the delta from CFD to real life downforce by making the package more accurate to CAD is the biggest goal this year as well as improving our rules clearance</p><p>Aero Justification - Summary of lap sim and GP A/B testing results. Lap sim shows more downforce scores more points, GP testing verified the speed increase in real life. Roughly 2x point increase from aero 2019 → 2020</p><p>Requirements (Minimum Values) - What I should have called the min values slides. Biggest change is how we determine our aero package goals. In previous years the target for Cl, Cd, weight based on prior aero package, mass flow became a consideration in 18 and 19. This year moving to requirements for Cd, Front %, mass flow. Weight has a max but we are easily passing (should quantify it though). Cl and weight are the two parameters where there is no requirement, just a number that we need to min/max. We have goals that we would like for these but they are first on the chopping block if we are not hitting our Cd, F/R, RMF numbers</p><p>Current values - Read the table. We see a 10% increase in downforce from 2019, 30% reduction in weight, most other parameters are similar.</p><p>CFD - Raunaq should fill this in eventually. Summary is increase in cell count from 3mn to 35mn. Changed from k-e to S-A turb model. Raunaq and I have issues with our interpretation of real world driving data. Raunaq's take (correct me if I am wrong) is that from a CFD perspective, the shock pot data is not usable due to many uncontrolled factors (wind, noise, temp, etc) and difference in build of aero package compared to CAD. I see these as sources of error between CFD and the package as a whole and something that should be considered when designing parts. You will never be able to control all of these at comp or when testing.</p><p>Component Design - Going to go into detail for each part below</p><p>FW - Similar to 2019. Low endplate ground clearance to seal lower surface. Large inner flaps to increase downforce and shift balance to front. Just a quick timeline and summary of FW development for future generations: </p><p>2017 - genetic optimization of flap profiles, 3 elements new main element</p><p>2018 - flap refinements</p><p>2019 - move back to 2017 profiles, split inner channel into 2 sections for more downforce. front limited by mass flow.</p><p>2020 - new everything</p><p>SW - Component with most changes for 2020. Tunnels rather than wing profiles for making it easier to manufacture and match to CAD. Narrowed UT for yaw performance and weight savings (remove tow bar and reduce plies). Also reduces amount of UT that needs to be supported.</p><p>RW - Similar to 2019 since we're still front limited. Improved mounting analysis. Shell mesh, 2 tie rods → 1.5lb weight saving.</p><p>Bodywork - No more chassis wrap, switching to molded panels for weight and manufacturability reasons</p><p>Composite Analysis - I need to make a confluence page for this. Brief summary is as follows. Program takes inputs (ply mat props, ply order, ply orientation, core props (opt)) and calculates stiffness and compliance matrices. These are then applied to any specific load case (sandwich panel, wing spar/skin) from which stress, strain, deflection, failure force can be determined. &quot;Validated&quot; with one data point on one spar and a couple sandwich panels. Error is about 15-20% at the moment. Biggest guess to this error is material properties, since we are either using expired material or a layup where material props can vary (infusion/wet layup).</p><p>Manufacturing improvements - Moving to use the carbon analysis model for layup schedule. Hollow core wings with spars on large elements (FW main element, RW main and flaps). One key thing not in the presentation is that all wings have constant chord/profile/alpha to allow for emergency foam core if hollow core doesn't work. Doing as few wet layups as possible in 2020. Infusion for endplates, wing skins, UT, tunnels, prepreg for nosecone, sidepods, firewall, floorpan, headrest, wheel, fan shouds, oil belt cover.</p><p><br/></p><p>Not very many questions, only Brian and Adam were able to make it for aero.</p><p><strong><u>Aerodynamics Sub-Team</u></strong></p><ul><li>CFD<ul><li>Put a metric on how all our improvements were measured</li><li>Which bounds are convergence is in</li><li>Mesh<ul><li>Consider looking at accuracy between different mesh types to see how we decided upon the mesh</li><li>Want to have the velocity normal at each mesh cell which is why Polyhedral is the best</li><li>Look more into cell quality metric and how it’s being calculated in STAR-CCM+</li><li>Make sure to show picture of Wall Y+ mesh</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Design Question: Why you want your simulation to converge faster disregarding having the simulation faster<ul><li>If you converge in less iterations that means your flow is well behaved around your car</li><li>Structures<ul><li>Be careful not to hyper optimize any weight savings since the weight of the Aero package relative to the car is already low</li><li>Consider Jacobian as a mesh</li><li>Shock pot<ul><li>Make sure to know tolerance per pound of weight</li><li>Consider air flow to the brakes eventually</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><h1 id="id-10/12/2019AlumniDesignReviewatPreliminaryDesignDeadline-Drivetrain">Drivetrain</h1><p><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper"><a class="confluence-embedded-file" href="/download/attachments/130162429/Drivetrain_PDR.pptx?version=1&amp;modificationDate=1571275692000&amp;api=v2" data-nice-type="PowerPoint Presentation" data-file-src="/download/attachments/130162429/Drivetrain_PDR.pptx?version=1&amp;modificationDate=1571275692000&amp;api=v2" data-linked-resource-id="130163680" data-linked-resource-type="attachment" data-linked-resource-container-id="130162429" data-linked-resource-default-alias="Drivetrain_PDR.pptx" data-mime-type="application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.presentationml.presentation" data-has-thumbnail="true" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-can-edit="true" aria-label="Drivetrain_PDR.pptx" draggable="false"><img src="rest/documentConversion/latest/conversion/thumbnail/130163680/1" height="250" alt="" draggable="false"/></a><span class="companion-edit-button-placeholder edit-button-overlay" data-linked-resource-container-id="130162429" data-linked-resource-id="130163680" data-template-name="companionEditIcon" data-source-location="embedded-attachment"></span></span></p><ul style="list-style-type: square;"><li>Turnbuckles<ul style="list-style-type: square;"><li>Ensure that the uprights cannot deflect side-to-side easily</li><li>Create and run ANSYS model for uprights with a 5 degree angle (about vertical axis) to determine if a failure would occur due to turnbuckle sway</li></ul></li></ul>
