                    <p><br/></p><p>In order to determine a layups schedule's properties and pass SES, test panels must be made for 3-point-bending (3pb) and perimeter shear tests. The 3pb final panels should measure 50 cm x 27.5 cm, and the perimeter shear panels should measure 10 cm x 10 cm.  Below, the instructions for making these panels from laying up, curing, and water jetting is explained. </p><p>NOTE: If you have not done prepreg layups before, it is necessary to begin learning with an experienced member.</p><h2 id="HowtoMakeSESTestPanels-Step-by-stepguide">Step-by-step guide</h2><p><strong>Planning</strong></p><ol><li>Determine the layup schedule you want to test <u><strong>(see other yet to be filled)</strong></u></li><li>Gather all the materials you need (talk to Treasurer if more need to be ordered)<br/><ol><li>Prepreg Carbon Fiber</li><li>Film Adhesive</li><li>Core</li><li>Freekote</li><li>Acetone</li><li>Vacuum Bag</li><li>Vacuum Tape</li><li>Breather</li><li>Peel Ply</li><li>Metal Plate (to layup on.

You can do this process on you own but it takes longer, is more tedious, and if you cannot lift heavy things, may be very difficult. Schedule 3-4 hours for the layup.</li></ol><p><strong>Set-up</strong> (a.k.a. cutting things, find a good pair of scissors)</p><ol><li><p>Clear off a table to work on.</p></li><li><p><span>Have a border of 1.5-2 cm for all pieces of the panel. This will allow for uneven cuts and other small mistakes around the border that can be waterjet away after.</span></p></li><li><p>Take the prepreg out of the freezer and cut the plies that you need (0, -45, +45, and 90) using the templates for three-point-bending and/or perimeter shear. It is helpful to label what orientation each ply is in sharpie on the removable plastic coating.</p></li><li><p>If including core, take the film adhesive out of the freezer and put the prepreg back into the freezer. Cut two pieces of film adhesive to size per test panel.</p></li><li><p>Replace the film adhesive in the freezer.</p></li><li><p>Cut a strip of breather that is long enough to fit inside all the crevices or holes such that the fabric is not in tension.</p></li><li><p>Cut a strip of the peel ply that will be big enough to cover each of the test panels plus a couple inch border. It is better for this to be a little larger than a little smaller.</p></li><li><p>Cut the vacuum bag to be about six inches longer than the length of the plate. The vacuum bag comes folded, so once cut from the roll, open it and cut it along the seam. You will use both halves.</p></li><li><p>On the half of the vacuum bag that you will be using, spray some water on one side only, fold it in half, water touching water, and set it somewhere to sit while you continue. This makes the bag more pliable, which will be very helpful when you are sealing it to the plate; sharp corners will be less of a concern. It is important to remember that water should not touch the dry side. The dry side will be what is inside the vacuum, and water cannot be present.</p></li><li><p>Finally, cut the core that you plan on using, if you are using core.</p></li></ol><p><strong>Doing the Layup</strong></p><ol><li>Prep the metal plate surface by cleaning it with acetone. You can use paper towels for this. If there is any resin left over from a previous layup, try to get it all off. You don’t want any additional resin the vacuum while the panels are curing.</li><li>Wipe the plate down with Freekote. You should use a clean cloth towel/rag for this. Be careful to not get any on your skin. It is easiest to use a circular motion with the rag to cover the whole surface. If parts of the surface are not covered, then the panels will not release in those areas or resin will stick to it (which removes that resin from the panels and means you have to do more work to clean the plate next time you layup).</li><li>Begin laying down the first side of your sandwich panels (or all the carbon for no-core pieces). Reference your plans on layup schedules as much as you need to; it is better to check it often and layup in the correct order than it is to make a mistake and have to restart.<br/><ol><li>To remove the plastic coating from one side of the prepreg, compressed air cans held upside down at an angle will let some of the propellant release. This will temporarily freeze the plastic coating (be sure to keep your fingers away from the nozzle). If you spray this in the corner of the prepreg, the plastic coating will be much easier to remove. If you do not have compressed air cans, you can use razors to lightly score the coating starting at the corner and pulling in. As long as you don’t press into the carbon, there should be no issues with damaging the carbon.</li><li>With one side of the carbon bare, lay it onto the metal plate and press it down starting from the center of the panel and moving to the edges. This will help it lie flat and remove any air bubbles.</li><li>Remove the other side of the plastic coating.</li><li>Continue this process until all the carbon for one side of your panel is layered for all panels.</li><li>The film adhesive has two different types of coating protecting it: one white, waxy paper, and one red plastic. The white, waxy paper removes the easiest, so start by removing that and pressing the film adhesive onto the prepreg in the same manner as you did each layer of carbon fiber. KEEP THE OTHER LAYER ON.</li></ol></li><li>Debulk the first half of the sandwich panel. This will still be done if there will be no core used; the only difference is that this will be the last step if no core is used, and the wetted vacuum bag should be used instead of the non-wetted vacuum bag.<ol><li>Line the metal plate with vacuum tape. Keep the wax paper intact on the upper side of the vacuum tape to keep it sticky.</li><li>Place the peel ply over each panel.</li><li>Place the breather over all panels.</li><li>Use the extra breather to pad the placement of the valve. The bottom half of the valve should be placed where there is extra space; it should not be on top of any panel.</li><li>Get the dry half of the vacuum bag that was cut earlier and lay it on top of the plate.</li><li>Starting from a corner, adhere the vacuum bag to the vacuum tape. You want to use the edge of the vacuum bag; this will have the vacuum bag be pillowed up in the center. This ensures that the bag can cover all surfaces tightly. This is most important when the core is present.<br/><ol><li>There will be pleats in your bag. When you start from each corner, there will (and should) be more bag than there is tape. Leave open pockets of the bag that will be filled with extra vacuum tape.</li><li>Get a strip of vacuum tape that is twice the height of the pleat. Begin adhering the vacuum tape to the base of one side of the pleat. Stick it along the open loop of the bag until the whole circumference of the loop has vacuum tape on it. Squish the loop together to make a line (pleat). Pinch the base to make sure there are no small holes that air can get through.</li></ol></li><li>Once the vacuum bag is secured in place, hold down the bottom of the valve and cut a hole in the bag that lines up with the center of the valve.</li><li>Secure the top of the valve to the bottom, making sure you seal it all the way.</li><li>Vacuum air out of the bag with the pump. Listen to see if you hear any high pitched squeal. This is air entering the bag. Follow the sounds to press down on the vacuum tape where the holes are. If you can’t find it but you still hear it, you can just press down on every part of the tape to be sure. Another indication that there is a leak is if you can move the vacuum bag around.</li><li>Keep the vacuum on for 15 minutes.</li><li>After 15 minutes, remove the vacuum pump and take off the vacuum bag and vacuum tape. Set the breather, valve, and the peel ply aside.</li></ol></li><li>Take the plastic coating off the film adhesive.</li><li>Press the core onto the film adhesive.</li><li>Finish the layup starting by adding the next layer of film adhesive on top of the core, then the rest of the prepreg according to your planned layup schedule.</li><li>Add another border of vacuum tape.</li><li>Layer the peel ply and breather on top of the panels again as you did before.</li><li>Close off the plate with the vacuum bad as you did before.</li><li>Debulk for another 15 minutes.</li><li>Disconnect the vacuum pump.</li><li>Leave the vacuum on the plate intact. Wait another 15 minutes to ensure that the vacuum stays. If it does not, there is a leak, you need to find it and redo the vacuuming process.</li><li>Clean up, set your layup aside; you are done.</li></ol><p><strong>Curing</strong></p><ol><li>Once you have a time scheduled with the CMSC to cure the panel, reserve time in the BIDC to use the waterjet (book 2-3 hours, minimum recommended is 1.5 hours).</li><li>Before you get to the CMSC, make sure you know what the cure cycle is for the prepreg. This information should be readily available from the manufacturing company.</li><li>Plan to drop off the panel in the morning between 9:00 - 10:00 am and pick it up between 4:00 - 5:30 pm. Times are dependent on who your contact is (as they are usually grad students who have schedules that change each semester).</li><li>When you have the cured layup back in our BIDC workspace, you can rip off the bag and pry the panels off the plate (if they don't release freely).</li></ol><p><strong>Waterjetting</strong></p><ol><li>Be sure that you have reserved time at the BIDC to use the waterjet.<ol><li>The minimum reasonable amount of time to schedule is 1.5 hours, although 2-3 hours would be better.</li><li>It is better to schedule too much time and leave early than to not schedule enough time. You can also split waterjetting into multiple time slots depending  on the number of panels you have laid up.</li></ol></li><li>When you get to the BIDC, the person at the front desk may ask you for an ORD file, a normal requirement for most waterjetting operations, but you will kindly explain that you are with the FSAE team and are here to cut rectangles, and that you will do that manually. </li><li>Upon entering the BIDC, go to the back in our area and get 2-4 panels (depending on how long you will be waterjetting).</li><li>Go to the waterjet and ask for a TA.<ol><li>Once you do this enough, most TAs will know you, and they will trust you to operate the waterjet on your own.</li><li>Until then, it is good to get someone to be with you as you set up. This is good for you to keep improving at waterjet operation and also for the TAs at the BIDC to not be mad at you for working a machine that explicitly says ‘operate only with TA’.</li><li>Most times, if you feel confident in your skills, the TA will stay with you through the cutting of one panel, see that you are good on your own, and leave you be.</li></ol></li><li>Secure the panel in place on the waterjet.<ol><li>Ask the TA for help (until both you and the TA have confidence in you to do it on your own).</li><li>Try to line it up parallel to the sides of the waterjet so that the rectangle does not need to be titled when cut.</li><li>It is most useful to hold the panel down in two places as close to the edge of the panel as you can get. We want to be able to cut the rectangle in one pass, so the clamps should not be too far onto the panel (the template used for cutting the panel material usually as only a few centimeters around the edge.</li><li>Remember to get a block to rest the other half of the clamp on; it should be slightly taller than the panel so that the clamping force is downward on the panel.</li></ol></li><li>Check the cut path (and then cut).<ol><li>This is an iterative process that you will improve at with practice. Again, with the help of the TA, you should find the rectangle path to be cut. There are saved ORD files for this in the FSAE Client Folder on their computer. Open the file for the panel you want to cut.</li><li>Raise the cutting head up until you can get your hand underneath and remove the skirt from around the cutting nozzle. This will allow you to see exactly where it will cut. This is important because we often cut very close to the edge/clamps.</li><li>Use the jog controls to move the nozzle to a point in the bottom left corner of the panel. Set this as your user home per TA instructions.</li><li>You can use the jog controls on the computer to move the nozzle around. The shape of the panel will be on the screen and you will be able to see where the nozzle is relative to the perimeter in the form of intermittent red dots. Use the jog controls, but have your eyes on where the actual nozzle is relative to the clamps and the edge.<br/><ol><li><span><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);"> If it looks like the nozzle will hit a clamp or go off the edge, reset where the home position is, if possible.</span></span></li><li><span><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);"><span><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);">If not possible, you can move the clamps, or rotate the panel.</span></span><br/></span></span></li></ol></li><li><span><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);"><span><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);"><span><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);">Once you have a clear path for the nozzle to follow and the TA checks off on it, then follow the TA’s instructions to operate the machine and cut the panel.</span></span><br/></span></span></span></span></li></ol></li><li><span><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);"><span><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);"><span><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);"><span><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);">Repeat this process for as many panels as needed and be sure to clean up well afterwards, including mopping water off the floor.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></li></ol><p><span><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);"><span><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);"><span><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);"><span><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);"><br/></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p><p><span><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);"><span><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);"><span><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);"><span><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);"><br/></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p><h2 id="HowtoMakeSESTestPanels-Relatedarticles">Related articles</h2><p></p><p>
