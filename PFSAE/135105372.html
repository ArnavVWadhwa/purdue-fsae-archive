                    <h2 id="Uprights(Suspension,becausedrivetrainthinkstheymakeuprights)-Basics">Basics</h2><p>Start with squaring up stock that is to thickness of the part. As far as length and width, it should be ~0.100-0.200 larger than the footprint of the part. Making the stock as square as possible is important for a quality upright as the CNC will touch off on various corners of the stock.</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>Some important notes to help mitigate mistakes and make things less confusing:</p><ul style="list-style-type: square;"><li>Make sure a square edge is aligned with the principle coordinate system</li><li>Assign one corner of the upright as the XY origin and keep that, when flipping the part for multiple operations, always use that corner<br/><ul style="list-style-type: square;"><li>Ie you might touch off on the bottom left corner of the stock in operation 1, but top left in operation 2 to ensure all the features align from one side to the other. This is why squareness of the stock is important, but getting the stock dimension exactly to what's in CAM is less important.</li></ul></li><li>In Mastercam, once you place the stock around the part, always keep it there (ie if the edge of the upright is 0.080 from the edge of stock, always keep it there). This is relatively easy to maintain as long as you move stock and part around together in Mastercam.</li></ul>
