                    <p><strong>From Ben's article:</strong></p><h2 style="" id="PF23TrackandWheelbase-Wheelbase">Wheelbase</h2><p style="">Lap sim indicates that there is increase in lateral acceleration as wheelbase increases. However, geometry indicates that the course gets larger because of the wheelbase. When this is taken into account, as well as weight from the extra length of each tube at a cross section of the chassis, it barely matters. </p><h2 style="" id="PF23TrackandWheelbase-Track">Track</h2><p style="">Can prove with lap time simulation that smallest is best. This is done by adjusting the track (course) to be smaller or larger based on track width. IE a 90 degree corner is still a 90 degree corner, but it is now a larger radius by 1/2 the increase in track width. How small you can go is then constrained by the tilt test or predicted rollover whichever comes first. Applying a 1.1 safety factor to tilt test seems reasonable.</p><p style=""><br/></p><p style=""><strong>My input:</strong></p><h2 style="" id="PF23TrackandWheelbase-Wheelbase.1">Wheelbase</h2><p>Interesting to say that wheelbase &quot;barely matters&quot;. Claude has always said in his optimum G papers that there should be no reason that an FSAE team should run more than the minimum wheelbase (1525 mm), and we should do a deep dive into his articles to find out why. We'll be running 1525 mm + 0.25 in. for a little wiggle room in manufacturing. </p><p><br/></p>
