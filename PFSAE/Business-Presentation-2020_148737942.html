                    <p><strong><u>*CAN EVERYONE HERE ME ALRIGHT*</u></strong></p><p><strong><u> </u></strong></p><p><strong><u>Slide 1:</u></strong> “Hi my name is ___ and I am the CEO (CFO, etc…) of Purdue Formula SAE” (for everyone presenting)</p><p><br/></p><p>Today we will be showcasing the progress of the R&amp;D Reduction Plan that was voted into action last year. </p><p><br/></p><p><strong><u>Slide 2: </u></strong>“We were tasked to reduce our R&amp;D department cost by 90% such that our company would be better positioned for an economic downturn. Our approach included two main steps to reduce this cost, and a third step to help bring in more sales to offset any losses. The first step was to freeze all new designs for future vehicle development, shift our engineering staff from R&amp;D to manufacturing, and use those engineers to maximize efficiency and lower our cost of manufacturing.</p><p><br/></p><p>Next, our estimates suggest that we will lose 10% of our sales in the next year, which means we will need to modify our business model to accumulate more cash and pay off more debt in the short term to prevent a deficit in cash flow. Hindering our company from performing daily tasks. </p><p><br/></p><p>Finally with our huge success in the karting market we will pursue growth in online sales for our cars through social media and other web based forums.”</p><p><br/></p><p><strong><u>Slide 3:</u></strong> Our Research and development team has been hard at work over the last seven years designing and developing a vehicle that brought the market by storm. When we first started up most of the business expenses went entirely to R&amp;D. In 2019 Q4 we spend just over 1.3 million dollars on parts, aerodynamic test molds, CAD, CAM, FEA software, and our R&amp;D staff. </p><p><br/></p><p>With the projected downturn we need to recognize that as a luxury good provider our revenue will vary directly with the economy. With our R&amp;D department being at full capacity and because our vehicle design is varying less and less, R&amp;D does not need to be as large as it is. So by cutting the department we provide Purdue Formula SAE with an opportunity to prepare for this downturn”</p><p><br/></p><p><strong><u>Slide 4:</u></strong> In an effort to reduce our R&amp;D expenses, we will freezing our vehicle design which allows us to reduce the number of CAD package, FEA, and CFD licenses we own. With the design freeze we will no longer be producing aerodynamic test molds freeing up machine time and cost of goods for test models. We will keep all our current molds for future use. For any further development, we will switch from carbon fiber to fiberglass and sheet steel flat plates. </p><p><br/></p><p>These efforts will significantly reduce our expenses but we do not reach the 90% threshold, so ultimately we needed to reduce the headcount of our engineers. </p><p><br/></p><p><strong><u>Slide 5:</u></strong> The reduction in headcount achieves the biggest single cost reduction of over $500,000 per quarter. But with this move we will be losing much more than just headcount, we lose experience, trust, and loyalty, all worth more than money could ever buy. Therefore we have worked with our management staff to shift as many engineers that were willing, to the manufacturing plants so that we maintain that trust and retain the employee’s experience. </p><p><br/></p><p>Our most senior engineers will be the ones staying in the department focusing mostly on design work and software validation. We will not willingly fire any employee as to maintain that trust and loyalty but we should expect a few to leave. </p><p><br/></p><p><strong><u>Slide 6:</u></strong> The shifted engineers from R&amp;D will join our manufacturing team to help optimize our work flow through lean manufacturing and six sigma policies. Because of our R&amp;D engineers’ experience and familiarity with our vehicle design they will be able to learn from and apply more optimal strategies for manufacturing. The additional engineers will help find cost reductions and improve the manufacturability of our vehicles. Thus providing higher profit margins to help stabilize our company now and for the future. This win-win scenario helps bolster our employee moral which will prove vital through an economic recession ”</p><p><br/></p><p><strong><u>Slide 7:</u></strong> “Moving to our accounting strategies, we use a percentage of sales based approach to predict our income for the upcoming quarter. </p><p><br/></p><p>With the economic downturn, we project our sales to drop by 10% in the coming year. We will shift our production from 150 car sales per quarter to 135 car sales per quarter. But with the 90% reduction in R&amp;D expenses we project a $400,000 increase to net income which we will use to increase our cash reserves and pay off our short term debt.”</p><p><br/></p><p><strong><u>Slide 8:</u></strong> Prior to the forecasting of the downturn as shown in the 2019 Q4 chart, our Accounting strategy was to maintain a D2E ratio of approximately 2, and only keep small amounts of cash on hand. Both of which contribute to maximizing our potential production. This allows for most of the funds to purchase inventory and grow our fixed assets to scale production. </p><p><br/></p><p>In order to prepare for an economic downturn, we need to change our strategy such that we have enough cash on hand to maintain operating cash flow while losing sales. </p><p><br/></p><p>Because we project a 10% loss, we will not be purchasing new fixed assets meaning that the depreciation expense for our fixed assets can go straight into our cash reserves. We use the MARCS Depreciation model to get the most tax shielding. We will also be selling more from inventory and collecting on our accounts receivable to drive up our cash reserve to over $1M. With the additional $400,000 in our retained earnings, we will pay off our short term debt. Shifting our D2E ratio to 1.17 and our current assets to approximately $1.5M. This liquidity allow us to be more flexible in a time of recession.</p><p><br/></p><p><strong><u>Slide 9: </u></strong>“In North America our researched Serviceable Available Market was just over 3.5 billion dollars last year and our revenue of over $20M puts us at about %0.59 market share. This year with the economic downturn we do project to lose market share due to our higher entry price, but with these cost reductions made and accounting measures implemented we will be able to recover much quicker than our competitors”</p><p><br/></p><p><strong><u> </u></strong></p><p><strong><u>Slide 10:</u></strong> “Lastly, with the huge growth into the karting market, we feel it fit to advertise on social media and other web-based forums to draw more sales, in this time of a potential drought. We believe that through this advertising campaign we can reach a wider and younger audience. We filmed a short commercial for our company, and we hope you enjoy it.”</p><p><br/></p><p>Thank you to Noah Sohaki and Colby Goyette for the amazing camera and editing work. We will use this video as an advertisement on social media to draw in more sales to pad our losses in the market.</p><p><br/></p><p><strong><u>Slide 11: QUESTIONS?</u></strong></p><p><strong><u> </u></strong></p><p><strong>Anticipated Questions:</strong></p><p>-Moving all engineers to manufacturing, competitors have better designs, how to deal with this?</p><p>            -This shift in staff could be temporary. </p><p>            -Emphasize the opportunity to have our R&amp;D engineers critiquing and improving our manufacturing thus reducing our COGS permanently. Driving our Profit margins up which will help us fund further development in the future</p><p>            -We understand that this shift will impact our development and our competitors will most likely take a technological advantage over us, but with our financial standings we will be able to fund more development in the future which will allow us to regain our dominant designs </p><p>            - During this downturn we feel like we can maintain our dominant design</p><p><br/></p><p>-Unhappiness – Worked with staff already and for those uneasy we worked with other management to help with transition, but for those who don’t want to make the transition we will help them find employment else where </p><p><br/></p><p>-Social Media = Youth engagement </p><p><br/></p><p>-Where did you get all of your #’s from?</p><p>            -Excel Sheet</p><p><br/></p><p>-Why important to pay off short term debt?</p><p>            -Collectors still expect $ even in time of recession</p><p>            -So paying off early will allow us more flexibility and fewer interest expense payments.</p><p><br/></p><p>-Why important to have a large cash reserve?</p><p>            -Because if we go some time before a sale is made, we still need to pay bills, salaries, and other fixed costs so having the cash on hand will reduce any down time and afford us the option to not take out additional loans</p><p><br/></p><p>-What are Accounts Receivable?</p><p>            -Money that is owed to us, mostly lay away offers and other loan payments for our vehicles.</p><p>            </p><p>-What flexibility do you gain from this situation?</p><p>            -By having a more liquid portfolio we can make investment decisions much quicker. If we think the economy is being restored then we can spend our cash immediately to ramp up production and R&amp;D development much quicker than our competitors, or if we think the economy is not getting better then we can afford to lower our production even further and use the cash on hand to pay off fixed costs rather than take out more loans for those costs</p><p><br/></p><p>-What happens to the cost of the employee’s transferring to manufacturing</p><p>            -Their salary is included in our COGS for 2020 Q1. We start with the 10% reduction in COGS because of the reduced sales then add the compensation for our engineers. </p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Judge’s Questions:</strong></p><p>What sets your vehicle apart from your competitors?</p><p><br/></p><p>What package options are available for sale of your vehicle?</p><p>-Have you considered offering your vehicle in a non-aero package?</p><p><br/></p><p>What design choices would you make to reduce costs?</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><strong>Judge’s Comments:</strong></p><p>1) More about the vehicle </p><p>Commercial – move to beging to get excited </p><p>More vehicle information</p><p>One side couldn’t read</p><p><br/></p><p>2) Good slides</p><p>Good strategy </p><p>Well thought out </p><p>Good approach to R&amp;D staffing</p><p>More vehicle backgrounds</p><p>Customer demographic</p>
