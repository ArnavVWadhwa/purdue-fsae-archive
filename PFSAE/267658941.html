exhaust gases</span><ul><li><span>More oxygen means running leaner assuming no leaks</span></li></ul></li><li><span>A leak will show the engine as running leaner as exhaust gases will flow out and

small period after start in a closed-loop system</span><ul><li><span>Heated Exhaust Gas Oxygen (HEGO) sensors are made for this purpose</span><ul><li><span>They have heaters so that they work on engine start as startup is critical for emissions as engines run slightly rich when they are cold</span></li></ul></li></ul></li><li><span>Increased CAM duration can cause issues as some unburned intake mixture can flow through the exhaust increasing the oxygen reading</span></li><li><span>Sensitive to exhaust backpressure (rich will read richer and lean will read leaner)</span><ul><li><span>Sensors should be installed after turbochargers for this reason</span></li><li><span>The closer the sensor is to the engine the greater the transient accuracy will be due
