                    <h2 style="" id="PF23Dampers-Dampers">Dampers</h2><p style="">On a basic level, a damper is an item that gives a certain force for a certain velocity and are modeled as a force vs. velocity table. I'm sure it's possible to get some data online, but let it be known that along with dampers comes hysteresis. This means that as a damper goes &quot;up&quot; in travel and then comes back &quot;down&quot;, the force for a given velocity might be different between those two strokes. People in the racing industry have worked a lot on getting rid of this hysteresis effect, and now there are dampers that include very little hysteresis, but once you introduce inertance, hysteresis is back at it. Inertance is just a given force for a certain acceleration. <strong>What does the hysteresis look like on our dampers, and do they have any inertance?</strong></p><p style="">There are four total damper settings that matter: Low-speed compression (LSC), Low-speed rebound (LSR), High-speed compression (HSC), and High-speed rebound (HSR).  The high-speed settings determine how the car handles sudden inputs like a sharp bump or high frequency bumps. The low-speed rebound affects transient vehicle balance during turn in, corner exit, and direction change (this is why we tune our roll centers to the low speed settings). This document (<a class="external-link" href="https://www.ohlinsusa.com/files/files/TTX25%20MkII%20Dyno%20lbs%20vs%20ips.pdf" rel="nofollow" style="">https://www.ohlinsusa.com/files/files/TTX25%20MkII%20Dyno%20lbs%20vs%20ips.pdf</a>) has dyno plots for the ohlins TTx25 that we have used since 2016. (We get them in the C12 / R12 valving configuration). The slow speed adjusters change the slope of the first part of the graph. The slope in this force vs. velocity graph <em>is the damping rate.</em> The high speed adjusters, however, do not change the slope of the second part of the graph. Instead, they change where that second part intercepts the first part. The slope of the second part is always what it is for a given damper valving. For observing transient tuning in simulation (Adams Car), it is only really necessary to include the first part, as the second only comes into play due to road surface irregularities. Check this by looking at the damper speeds in the simulation. My gut tells me that you wouldn't really want to end up crossing over from one section of the graph to the other during regular maneuvering.</p><p style=""><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper confluence-embedded-manual-size"><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper confluence-embedded-manual-size"><img class="confluence-embedded-image" draggable="false" height="400" src="attachments/230654017/230654023.png" data-image-src="attachments/230654017/230654023.png" data-unresolved-comment-count="0" data-linked-resource-id="230654023" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="attachment" data-linked-resource-default-alias="image2019-12-26_13-22-18.png" data-base-url="https://wiki.itap.purdue.edu" data-linked-resource-content-type="image/png" data-linked-resource-container-id="230654017" data-linked-resource-container-version="2" alt=""></span></span></p><p style=""><br/></p><p style="">So there's how dampers can be adjusted, but thinking about them in the context of tuning the vehicle is a bit nastier. In short apply what you know about spring rates to dampers, except that it only occurs in particular transient situations. In any situation, think about which way the shocks are moving (compression vs extension). The corresponding damper settings will make an adjustment to the vehicle's balance on top of the balance from the spring rates. For example, to solve a turn in braking oversteer problem, the options would be to increase the low speed compression damping in the front or decrease the low speed extension rebound damping in the rear. The better choice between those would be dictated by whether you want the car to get over all more responsive or less twitchy. (Note in this case reverse differential settings or brake bias could have also potentially been used. Reverse diff settings are hard to tune, but making sure that the brake bias is in fact far enough forward at the speed of the corner making a problem would be the first thing to check.)</p>
