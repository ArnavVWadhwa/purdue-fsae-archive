                    <p>This page contains some of the justification for the priorities and order of components manufactured for PF22 during Fall 2021.

Traffic cones were likely last on my list as someone else could pretty easily take them over.</li><li>Rocker and Control arm components had to be done relatively early for welding and powdercoat. These parts are good to have ready to machine - ie stock and drawing ready. Every once in a while, something comes up and you cant run CNC (John is out sick, has a meeting, etc) so just have that ready so you can still take advantage of the time.</li></ul><h3 id="SuspensionManufacturingPriorities-ChronologicalOrderofBigTicketMachiningItems(Namesareclickablehyperlinkstothemanufacturingguide)">Chronological Order of Big Ticket Machining Items (Names are clickable hyperlinks to the manufacturing guide)</h3><ol><li><a href="Camber-Pieces_132157513.html">Camber Pieces</a> - Just getting back from summer, hadn't touched a mill or lathe for several months.
