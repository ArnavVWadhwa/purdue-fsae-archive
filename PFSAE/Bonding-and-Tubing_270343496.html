                    <p>On this page, we will discuss, the bonding parameters, tubing choice, testing and others parameter with the goal of building carbon-alloy suspension. This is not a complete guide to bonding any composite tubing to any alloy insert. However it is a useful starting point, and the information presented can be used as it is for less structural components.</p><ul><li>Bonding<ul><li>Surface prep</li><li>Resin</li><li>Bonding Process</li></ul></li><li>Tubing type and Shape</li><li>Testing Process<ul><li>Stages</li><li>Parameters</li><li>Performance investigation</li></ul></li></ul><p><br/></p><h3 id="BondingandTubing-Surfaceprep">Surface prep</h3><p>Surface preparation in bonding similar to painting and other processes is one of the most important components to pay attention to. It is the base of the entire bond. There are two main areas to pay attention to - insert and tube.</p><h3 id="BondingandTubing-Insertsurfaceprep"><strong>Insert surface prep</strong></h3><p>There are different methods of surface prep we can use, each with its own advantages and drawbacks. Some of them include sanding, sandblasting, etching with acid, alodine coating, and no prep. It is highly recommended to spend time prepping each surface, because even the slightest surface prep can have significant payback. We can differentiate insert prep into two main categories - mechanical treatment and chemical treatment. Both are effective to some extent, however chemical treatment is superior. For our purposes we have chosen to use an alodine etching kit (West System 860 Aluminium etching kit). We are choosing this specific kit, because it is very effective while also being cheap and widely available. This means we can essentially use it at any point in time. This would help us achieve sufficient yet consistent result on any component that requires some kind of bonding. As of Fall 2023, we will be sanding (keeping track of the outside diameter) and later anodising the inserts. Further detail on the sanding method and potential changes made will be provided once testing is complete. It should be noted that we are currently using aluminium. If in future a different alloy is to be used, we recommend you conduct research on bonding prep for the specific alloy/metal.</p><h3 id="BondingandTubing-Compositetubingprep"><strong>Composite tubing prep</strong></h3><p>Surface prep is just as important on one surface of the bond as it is on the other, thus tube prep is also crucial. One important differentiation to be made between the insert and the tube, is that the insert unlike the tube has isotropic properties. This means we should pay attention when prepping the tubes using any kind of abrasive tooling, since we can interfere with the layers of the tube, thus affecting the properties of the tube. As of Fall 2023 we will be sanding and cleaning the tube prior to bonding. Below is a description of other composite prepping. When at some point we have the budget and time, it is worth investigating them in further detail. They have potential for marginal gains but are not worth investigating at the current stage.</p><p><strong style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;">Peel ply</strong></p><p><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;">The goal of this method is to create a rough surface without using any kind of abrasion. Peel ply is to be added (on the inside) during the manufacturing of the tubes. As it is peeled off before bonding, it will provide a rougher surface for bonding. The possible limitations and disadvantages of this method is that it may yield a inconsistent inside diameter, as well as some variation of the ID from tube to tube (i.e. </span><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;">ovalize the tubes</span><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;">), as well as it has to be utilized during the layup process itself. However until we conduct our own testing, we can not reach an accurate conclusion on its effectiveness and limitations. </span></p><p><strong>Fiberglass layup</strong></p><p>Another option worth investigating is a <strong>fiberglass layup</strong>. The goal is to add an extra layer of fiberglass during the manufacturing process. This layer will initially increase the wall thickness of the tube. It is to then be sanded, bringing the wall thickness down to the desired size. This will provide us with a rough (more suitable for bonding) surface, while not losing any of the structural integrity of the carbon tube (we would not interfere with the layers of the tube). This method has some similar disadvantages to the peel-ply method. It has the potential to result in inconsistent wall thickness and ovalize the inside of the tube. However, it is easier to test, since we don't need to lay tubes of our own. It could be added to a tube we buy. It should be noted that a second bond is introduced into the system - composite tube to fiberglass.</p><h3 id="BondingandTubing-Bondlinecontrol:"><strong>Bond line control:</strong></h3><p>Another very significant parameter of the bond is how well we can control the uniformity of the bond gap. We have two methods of controlling this gap. First, we can make use of a jig or similar to position the insert and the tube, as they are getting bonded. This is the method used by FSAE MIT. The other method is the use of glass beads mixed with the resin. As the inserts and the tubes are then bonded, the beads only alloy a certain gap between the insert and the tube. This is the method we would be using for our testing. It provides more consistent results as well as an increase in the strength of the joint. If we are to compare the price of designing and manufacturing a jig to the price of the glass beads, the beads are significantly less expensive and easier to get. It is also true that we can change the gap much easier with the glass beads (different sizes available), where we would need to design and manufacture new components with the jig. Glass beads are also easier to use compared to a jig.</p><p>This component can be considered as part of the resin we are to use. Further research should be conducted on the interaction between the resin and the glass beads, as parameters such as viscosity and behavior under tension and compressions may have an effect on the strength of the bond.</p><h3 id="BondingandTubing-Tubing">Tubing</h3><p>The goal of the suspension system is to:</p><ul><li><span>design and manufacture the components that connect the rotating </span><span>and nonrotating components of suspension to the chassis without a large amount of deflection </span><span>(compliance)</span><span>​</span></li><li><span>connect the pre-determined SUS points to provide the vehicle with the </span><span>handling and dynamic characteristics chosen by the kinematic designer</span><span>​</span></li></ul><p><span>The goal of the suspension system of the car is to provide optimal grip during acceleration and deceleration, as well as cornering. This is a very complex task. To make the design process simpler we usually assume an infinitely stiff suspension system. Additionally, we also aim to decrease the mass of the unsprung mass. This makes the car more responsive and helps with suspension setup.</span></p><p><span>This is why we aim to find tubing with a high stiffness-to-weight ratio and isotropic qualities. In this part of the page, I will break down a few carbon layups for tubing as well as propose design goals for the future.</span></p><p>Carbon fiber is a material with nonisotropic properties. It performs very well in tension but is quite bad at everything else. However, it can be woven into a fabric, then that fabric can be placed in multiple orientations to achieve strength in the desired directions. This is why, assuming we have chosen the correct carbon layup, carbon becomes quite useful. Carbon also doesn't react easily with other materials/chemical and has low thermal expansion coefficient. One thing to note is that in our case, we should pay attention to galvanic corrosion in older components.</p><p>The easiest way to choose tubing is if the supplier has provided us with the properties of each tube. Estimating maximum load capacity is then relatively simple and can be done similarly to steel for example. One supplier which lists properties of some of their rubes is <span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);"><strong><a class="external-link" href="https://www.easycomposites.co.uk/15-5mm-roll-wrapped-carbon-fibre-tube" rel="nofollow" style="color: rgb(0,0,0);">Easy Composites</a></strong></span>. Unfortunately, most suppliers don't list tube properties, carbon properties, or the layup they are using. At the bottom of the page are example fabric properties of tubes from <strong><a class="external-link" href="https://www.rockwestcomposites.com/45409-uhm?queryID=64a8655918a84497cfd379302f543077&amp;objectID=2285&amp;indexName=magento2Live_default_products" rel="nofollow">RockWest</a></strong>.
