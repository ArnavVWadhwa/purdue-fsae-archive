                    <p>For PF23, we are seriously considering moving away from a differential. The diff is heavy and we almost always keep it on its most locked setting (more indicative of a spool), although I'm unsure of how much experimentation we have done with it in the past to be fair. Although the diff is &quot;only&quot; about 4 lb. weight reduction, this mass is also spinning (rotational inertia) and the farthest out powertrain component from the CG in the XY plane (yaw inertia), so it has more of an effect than you think. With that being said, my intuition from a vehicle dynamics standpoint is curious about low-speed corners where the input torque is low, and so the diff is not as locked up. I believe this would have a significant effect on low-speed cornering, which is what we mainly do in an autocross course. Afterall, in Indycar for the Iowa Speedway, I know a lot of teams ran a spool (I was able to see the inner wheel skipping and spuddering about in the paddock when they turned) but for the more road course and street circuit places, teams run a diff. Evaluation will have to be done on whether or not we should run one for PF23. </p><p>Relating this to event-specific set-ups, there shouldn't be any reason why we don't run a spool on acceleration to my knowledge. Less weight, less rotational inertia, and I feel like there isn't a reason to have the time delay of the friction faces engaging, although msg. Zach on teams if you know I'm wrong about this. </p>
