                    <p><strong><u>Purpose</u></strong></p><p>Currently, I think we don't know enough about the package that we are physically sending out on track. I don't think that great documentation exists of what we set out on track, and I think we can make it a lot easier and possibly integrate it with MoTeC data so it's really seamless. For instance, after seeing some of RLL's testing procedures and reflecting, I thought that spring testing could've gone a bit better. By setting up the car properly, then we know we have a package that we designed to, and if there is anything wrong with that package then we know it and can account for it in our analysis of what the car is behaving like. </p><p><u><strong>Outline</strong></u></p><p>There are two main things that I want to integrate to the team</p><ul><li>Set-up Book<br/><ul><li>The idea behind the set-up book is that it records every single variable that we can change on the car. This includes but is not limited to:<ul><li>Suspension:<ul><li>Weights</li><li>Camber</li><li>Toe</li><li>Springs</li><li>Damper Settings</li><li>Pressures</li><li>ARB</li><li><strong>Brake Bias?? (This is a variable to be filled out post run?)</strong></li></ul></li><li>Aero:<ul><li>FW Flap Angles</li><li>RW Flap Angles</li><li>Ride Heights</li></ul></li><li>Powertrain:<ul><li>Differential Tuning<ul><li>Preload</li><li>Ramp Angles</li><li>Number of clutch plates</li></ul></li><li>Final Drive Ratio (not generally easily tunable)</li><li><strong>Tune? Do we want a list of tunes? Or want to refer to some file?</strong></li></ul></li><li>Chassis:<br/><ul><li>Pedal box position</li><li>Throttle mounting position</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>In the set-up book, there can be other calculated sheets as well. Things like CoP, front weight dist., cross weight dist., etc. can all be calculated </li></ul></li><li>Run-sheet (could be integrated to the set-up book)<ul><li>Keeps track of all changes and weather – still want to more clearly define what this holds and why we need a separate sheet</li></ul></li></ul><p>From here, I think we can correlate our ADAMS simulations better. If we correlate the sims, we can trust the sims more, use the sims to try a bunch setups and find an optimal set-up for each event in the lab rather than on valuable testing time. </p><p><u><strong>Analysis / Reflection</strong></u></p><p><br/></p>
