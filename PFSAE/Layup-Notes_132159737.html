                    <div id="main-content" class="wiki-content group">
                    <p><strong>Body Panels Round 1:</strong></p><p>Wins:</p><ul style="list-style-type: square;"><li>Good surface finish - All panels had good surface finish and low void content. This more or less confirms our machining/painting/polishing process as ok for layups in the future. For reference, these panels were as follows:<ul style="list-style-type: square;"><li>Machine mold. Finish pass was 0.08&quot; stepover with a 1/2&quot; ball endmill. This should be reduced to less than 0.05&quot; for wings and other small molds.</li><li>Sand bare mold surface to 220 grit to remove tool marks and ridges from finish pass. </li><li>Paint with Duratec 707-002. Didn't see the exact coat thickness, but greater than 20 thou should be sufficient. We used 500ml of paint for these molds, probably should have used &gt;750ml.</li><li>Smooth with 220 grit to remove pinholes get uniform surface.</li><li>Wet sand to 1000 grit (220 → 500 → 800 → 1000). Should have gone up to 4000, but we were out of sandpaper and didn't want to remove too much material as we were starting to sand down to the bare tooling board.</li><li>Polish with 3 coats of wax.</li></ul></li><li>Resin flow - New flow layup worked very well. Using only one port for outlet with the feed line attached directly to the spiral tubing was able to cover the entire panel with no issues.</li><li>Flashbreaker tape around edges of mold - This allowed for easy starting of release from mold. Something we should continue doing, especially since we have so much excess flashbreaker tape.</li></ul><p>Losses:</p><ul style="list-style-type: square;"><li>Dry spot on one panel - Likely due to too little resin and poor vacuum/leaking</li><li>Poor vacuum - Lots of air leaking on one panel causing a number of issues. Dry spots and delamination were present in the affected area.</li><li>Bag too small - Biggest issue with these layups. The first 2 bags were too small for the mold, causing the bag to bridge on the edges of the mold. This left large chunks of resin on the corners. This can be fixed by making future bags at least 2x the size of the mold, potentially more depending on the mold depth.</li><li>Tape delamination - Carbon plies were delaminating with the tape on the edges of the plies being the starting point</li></ul><p>Notes for next layup: </p><ul style="list-style-type: square;"><li>Surface prep - wax walls and flanges. The carbon was impossible to get started demolding without damaging it in several places. Better surface prep in these areas should help with this</li><li>Ply layup - make sure there's enough slack in the consumables (release, flow media) to make sure the bag won't bridge. This is especially important on the release ply, since a space between the release ply and carbon with lead to the space being filled completely with resin</li><li>Tape - press down harder on tape. The surface on our molds isn't great, more force is required to stick the tape down compared to the aluminum flat plates.</li><li>Bagging - DOUBLE THE SIZE OF THE MOLD WITH THE BAG. Can't stress this enough. Pay attention to pleats in the corners to make sure that the bag can fit all the way inside and make contact with the carbon. Spend lots of time on pleats, since they're most likely to be the source of leaks, and a bigger bag will mean more pleats.</li><li>Carbon edges - Trim down the tape on the edges of the carbon to be as small as possible (under 1/8&quot; if possible). </li><li>Add 1 ply - Laid up both panels with 2 plies of 88gsm sigmatex spread tow. This was a mistake, should have been 3 plies.</li></ul><p><strong>Body Panel Front Right Round 2:</strong></p><p>Wins:</p><ul style="list-style-type: square;"><li>Part is actually usable</li><li>Good surface finish - Mold prep paid off. More importantly the part has a good surface finish after a 2nd layup, which further confirms our layup process for molds that will see 6-7 layups (fw, rw flaps)</li><li>No big resin pockets - Extra bag made corners and edges nice and clean<br/><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper confluence-embedded-manual-size"><img class="confluence-embedded-image" draggable="false" height="250" src="attachments/132159737/132160616.jpg" data-image-src="attachments/132159737/132160616.jpg" data-unresolved-comment-count="0" data-linked-resource-id="132160616" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="attachment" data-linked-resource-default-alias="IMG_0394.jpg" data-base-url="https://wiki.itap.purdue.edu" data-linked-resource-content-type="image/jpeg" data-linked-resource-container-id="132159737" data-linked-resource-container-version="6" alt=""></span></li></ul><p>Losses:</p><ul style="list-style-type: square;"><li>Dry spot - still seeing sections of each tow without adequate resin. This layup had ~600g of resin mixed with ~500g infused. I'm less inclined to believe that this is a resin issue and more that we were still lacking vacuum. An explanation is below:<ul style="list-style-type: square;"><li>Total surface area: Approx 32&quot;x16&quot;=512in^2 = 0.33m^2</li><li>Total carbon weight: 3x88gsm = 264gsm → 264gsm*0.33m^2 = 88g</li><li>Resin feed line usage: ~50g (typical for infusion)</li><li>Flow media resin usage: 700gsm resin usage (typical for flow media) → 700gsm*0.33m^2 = 233g</li><li>Total theoretical resin usage (assuming 50% resin content for ease of calculation - in reality this is closer to 40% or 45%): 88+50+233 = 371g</li></ul></li><li>The above value indicates that there is not a lack of resin in our part, and that we likely have vacuum or flow media issues.</li></ul><p>Notes for next layup:</p><ul style="list-style-type: square;"><li>Seal vacuum bag better</li></ul>
