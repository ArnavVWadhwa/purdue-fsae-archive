The tire dictates vehicle performance and must be the first decision made in design as it will drive overall architecture. There are only 4 tires in contact with the ground and the fastest car will optimize them in all situations. A more detailed discussion on optimizing tires deserves its own confluence page so I will dive more into the mechanics. A tire will have 3 Forces and 3 Moments. These forces and moments are functions of dozens of parameters but for the sake of simplicity we will simplify it to a function of f(FZ,alpha,kappa,gamma). Where FZ is tire normal load, alpha is slip angle, kappa is slip ratio, and gamma is inclination angle (or in the vehicle coordinate system most people know it as camber).</p><p><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper confluence-embedded-manual-size"><img class="confluence-embedded-image confluence-external-resource" draggable="false" height="250" src="https://s19532.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Tire-characteristics-ride-and-handling-768x384.png" data-image-src="https://s19532.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Tire-characteristics-ride-and-handling-768x384.png"></span></p><p><strong>3 Forces:</strong></p><ol><li>FZ Normal Load</li><li>FX Longitudinal Force</li><li>FY Lateral Force</li></ol><p><strong>3 Moments:</strong></p><ol><li>MZ Aligning Moment (Has huge impact on steering forces and driver feelings) aka contribution of pneumatic trail </li><li>MX Overturning Moment</li><li>MY Rolling Resistance Moment</li></ol><p><strong>3 Angles:</strong></p><ol><li>Alpha Slip Angle is the angle between the velocity vector of the tire and where the tire is heading; responsible for the development of lateral forces, and aligning moments, and overturning moment</li><li>Kappa (sometimes in literature sigma) slip ratio is defined in many ways but the simple view is ratio of the contact patch velocity to the no slip velocity condition.

For FSAE we have access to TTC <a class="external-link" href="https://www.fsaettc.org/viewforum.php?f=15" rel="nofollow">https://www.fsaettc.org/viewforum.php?f=15</a> (tire testing consortium) where the data for tires meant for FSAE cars is published along with forums that carry a wealth of knowledge on tires. Here you can find the specific test plans and raw data which can be used for analysis and the development of a tire model. For the purpose of this confluence page, I will not go into details on evaluating different tires or their curves. What you MUST KNOW is tires are heavily dependent on their temperatures, normal loads, and angles. Tires are load sensitive which means that as you increase normal load on the tire the coefficient of friction will decrease. This is the main idea behind controlling load transfer to maximize grip and performance. Another thing is tires are extremely non-linear so keep that in mind. Below is a image of a MTS test setup for a tire.</p><p><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper confluence-embedded-manual-size"><img class="confluence-embedded-image confluence-external-resource" draggable="false" height="150" src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gqDesPT9eF4/maxresdefault.jpg" data-image-src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gqDesPT9eF4/maxresdefault.jpg"></span></p><p>When looking at tire data it must be noted that the test belt will not represent the true tire performance on asphalt or whatever the track surface is. Because of this, tire performance will be overestimated and require knockdowns or scaling factors in the tire model to account for the difference in performance capabilities. I am sure there are a ton of methods to do this but the simple one that I use (may not be the best way) is to alter to coefficient usually called LMUY and LMUX in Pacjeka tire models. I move this factor down to ~0.625 for initial simulations. There has been a time where I was correlating brake data and had ~0.5 for the scale factor to match acceleration and normal loads at the speed to shock pot and vehicle telemetry. This is where tire wear, and temperature and a dozen other things make a difference but can be too complex for us to evaluate and study in less than a year. I would stick to 0.625 unless you have a *reason not to. </p><p>*Side note: Something I would like to do is use strain gauge data of CA to determine a more appropriate scale factor for vehicle simulation. For loads analysis it is safer to be on the more conservative side.</p><p>Also, because of tire data non-linearity it is extremely dangerous and inaccurate to extrapolate any tire data. I will admit that it will be required in most cases but it is important to questions results. An example is + inclination angle should increase lateral force and - should decrease. At loads higher than what it was tested at, I saw inaccurate behavior of inclination angle. I set gamma to 0 in most cases to eliminate this impact. If studies on gamma want to be done I would suggest using a 4 coefficient model (lower fidelity but easier to represent gamma better). You can look at TTC testing documents to learn more about the extrapolation limits but the summary is that for 16&quot; tires (so small) they could only take them from 50 to 250 lbf normal load before issues would occur on the test bench. Additionally, limits for slip angle were -15 to 15 degrees. Slip ratio is typically -0.15 to 0.15 however the smaller 16&quot; tires need an extension that does not allow for the collection of longitudinal loads. Because of this assumptions had to be made when dealing with 16&quot; tires such as scaling and using the same compound and size tire at the 18&quot; size for longitudinal estimates. Finally, no combined data was able to be collected on the tire (the most important data because we are always operating within a some slip ratio and slip angle combination). Most tire combined data can be estimated using friction ellipse model. This is where the max lateral and longitudinal loads are used with the equation of an ellipse to calculate some combined grip limit. More details to come!</p><p>By now you might be asking why do we need a tire model why not just use all this data? Its because using data is extremely slow and there is hysteresis effects of the tire. A model will condense this information into one single line that can be quick to use especially in high order simulations where computing time is valuable. There is alot of research on tire models and developing models. I will leave this for you to research and learn about on your own time. The most common is Pacjeka or MF5.2 modeling and coefficients. It is always good to plot the data to the model to prove correlation. </p><p><br/></p><h2 id="MATLABTireModelandUsage-MATLABMODEL"><strong><span style="color: rgb(0,0,255);">MATLAB MODEL</span></strong></h2><p><span style="color: rgb(0,51,102);">Quick Information: Model has 3 Modes.

The problem with this is that it becomes complicated and can take more time than some simple hand calcs that get us Almost 100% of the way there. To calculate the vehicle at steady state conditions a numerical solver is typically needed to handle load transfer until the difference between the input lateral acceleration to load transfer is = lateral acceleration from sum of tire forces (F=ma). The brute force method requires a best guess at vehicle performance but could also be determined more accurately with a vehicle simulation. From here that steady state acceleration can be used to determine the 4 tire loads which can be fed into the Tire Model shown above to determine the max contact patch loads. We don't have to look at all 4 tires if we are doing structural analysis because the most heavily loaded tire is the outside tire in cornering. It is important to do a quick check of the max load applied to the inside tire as the force vectors do change. For this case you can safely assume static load+aero contributiton (no load transfer) on the inside tire to make a conservative estimate. For longitudinal loads we assume the car is symmetric so again only care about one tire per axle. </p><p><br/></p><p><strong>Equations and Example:</strong></p><p style="margin-left: 40.0px;"><strong>Load Transfer </strong></p><p><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper confluence-embedded-manual-size"><img class="confluence-embedded-image" draggable="false" height="93" src="attachments/267661346/267661364.png" data-image-src="attachments/267661346/267661364.png" data-unresolved-comment-count="0" data-linked-resource-id="267661364" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="attachment" data-linked-resource-default-alias="image-2023-8-4_17-55-39.png" data-base-url="https://wiki.itap.purdue.edu" data-linked-resource-content-type="image/png" data-linked-resource-container-id="267661346" data-linked-resource-container-version="5" alt=""></span></p><p style="margin-left: 40.0px;"><strong>Required Vehicle Parameters</strong></p><p><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper confluence-embedded-manual-size"><img class="confluence-embedded-image" draggable="false" width="1000" src="attachments/267661346/267661367.png" data-image-src="attachments/267661346/267661367.png" data-unresolved-comment-count="0" data-linked-resource-id="267661367" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="attachment" data-linked-resource-default-alias="image-2023-8-4_18-4-46.png" data-base-url="https://wiki.itap.purdue.edu" data-linked-resource-content-type="image/png" data-linked-resource-container-id="267661346" data-linked-resource-container-version="5" alt=""></span></p><p style="margin-left: 40.0px;"><strong>Vehicle Limit Cases for Analysis</strong></p><p><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper confluence-embedded-manual-size"><img class="confluence-embedded-image" draggable="false" height="150" src="attachments/267661346/267661370.png" data-image-src="attachments/267661346/267661370.png" data-unresolved-comment-count="0" data-linked-resource-id="267661370" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="attachment" data-linked-resource-default-alias="image-2023-8-4_18-8-12.png" data-base-url="https://wiki.itap.purdue.edu" data-linked-resource-content-type="image/png" data-linked-resource-container-id="267661346" data-linked-resource-container-version="5" alt=""></span></p><p>Starts with defining various load cases and the failure mode. Max limit loading would be for yielding or buckling and these loads are defined as max possible load we could see and needs to survive at least once. Fatigue analysis is done the same way but based on cycles and using loading for typical operating loads. Input Long G and Lat G and Velocity are dependent on this max vehicle performance prediction. As stated before, this comes from vehicle simulation. Lap sim GGV is a good place to get these values.</p><p>Once those are determined the downforce and drag can easily be calculated. Downforce will be added to FZ and drag will be added to FX respectively as it is the force required to overcome and maintain steady state (mainly applies to pure cornering cases as this is included in performance Long G; Note FX is only reacted by the driven wheels so RWD would have FX in rear and neglect at the front). Following, load transfer calculations should be conducted. This is all we need to approximate FZ, think through each case and how the loads apply to the contact patch. Think through how FZ will change in each case (example: Max 3G bump requires FZ to be calculated as =3*Weight of 1/4 Car + Aero Contribution to that tire). Also think through signs and units when doing these calcs.</p><p><br/></p><p>Once FZ is calculated the other Loads can be determined with the Tire Model and filled in with documentation. *Reminder we easily see 300+ lbf in these calcs which is extrapolating the tire data and model beyond its correlated capabilities.</p><h2 id="MATLABTireModelandUsage-EXTRAS"><strong><span style="color: rgb(0,0,255);">EXTRAS</span></strong></h2><ul><li><span style="color: rgb(0,51,102);">Tire model is the same used in all in house Vehicle Dynamic Analysis and Simulations and thus can be applied to as such</span><ul><li><span style="color: rgb(0,51,102);">It could be worth building a nonlinear bicycle model and using this tire model if desired.
