                    <p><strong>Carbon Prepreg Testing (3 Point bending &amp; Perimeter Shear)</strong></p><p><strong>Spring 2019:</strong></p><p>The carbon used was unidirectional prepreg (Grafil TR 50S) and the honeycomb used was a half inch, 3/8” cell size Aluminum honeycomb.</p><p>The layups that were done were quasi isotropic [0°, 45°, 90°, -45°]<sub>UD</sub>.</p><p><strong>Manufacturing</strong>:</p><p>The plies and the honeycomb were all sandwiched together in one layup process with film adhesive in between the plies and the honeycomb. The resulting sandwich panel was left inside a vacuum bag and debulked overnight to get rid of all the air in between the plies. The layup was then brought to the CMSC, where it cured inside an oven at 1 bar pressure and 200°F.</p><p><strong>Results and Testing:</strong></p><p>The cell size of the honeycomb was too big and resulted in a poor sandwich panel because the carbon ended up squeezing inside the cells. It was decided to choose a honeycomb with a much smaller cell size to avoid the same result. <strong>LOSS</strong></p><p>The results obtained for three-point bending were insufficient to meet SES requirements, which was expected, because the failure loads of the panels were below the minimum accepted load. On a more positive note, the panels all failed due to ply failure which means that the manufacturing process was a success. <strong>LOSS/WIN</strong></p><p>The results obtained from perimeter shear were inconclusive because while it shows that the panels experienced a high enough force to pass SES, the perimeter shear (Force vs displacement) curve did not output the same curve as expected. It was assumed that the punch was not sliding into the material but rather crushing the material meaning that shear and normal stresses were experienced. Reducing the cell size of the core would be a way to fix this problem. <strong>INCONCLUSIVE</strong></p><p><strong>Fall 2019:</strong></p><p>The carbon used was Unidirectional Grafil TR 50S and Woven T300 2x2 3k. The core material used was a 1” thick, 1/8” cell size, 6.1pcf, 5052 Aluminum honeycomb.</p><p>Multiple layups were done. The layups include:</p><p>2 ply layup: [0 45 core 45 0]</p><p>4 ply layup: [0 0UD 0UD 45 core 45 0UD 0UD 0]x3</p><p>6 ply layup: [0 45 0UD 0UD 45 0 core 45 0 0UD 0UD 45 0]x3</p><p>10 ply layup: [0 45 0 45 0UD 0UD 45 0 45 0 core 45 0 45 0 0UD 0UD 45 0 45 0]</p><p><strong>Manufacturing:</strong></p><p>1)      The first method consisted in doing the same thing as for the panels in <strong>Spring 2019</strong>: layup the plies and the core all at once and leave it for debulking overnight.</p><p>2)      The second method consisted in laying up the laminates of each side of the core individually, debulking them overnight or for several hours, and then adding the core in between them and debulking the resulting sandwich panel.</p><p><strong>Results and Testing:</strong></p><p>Unlike last time, the cell size of the core was small enough such that the carbon did not get inside the cells, resulting in a flat surface. <strong>WIN</strong></p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p><p>Concerning three-point bending, the failure forces exceeded the minimum requirements to pass SES. The 2 ply and 4 ply layups were used to target the Front Bulkhead section and the 6 ply and 10 ply layups were used to target the requirements for the Side Impact Structure section. The panels passed rules for the Front Bulkhead section, however they failed to meet the absorbed energy requirement for the Side Impact Structure because the panels did not deflect enough. <strong>WIN/LOSS</strong></p><p>Moreover, there were many panels that failed due to delamination, meaning that the laminate would pop off the core. This is not desired because delamination results in weaker panels (lower failure forces). <strong>LOSS</strong></p><p>Regarding perimeter shear the results were satisfactory. All panels passed the desired loads for their respective sections of the car and the Force vs displacement curve resembled the one shown on SES meaning that the punch was applying a much larger shear force than normal force. <strong>WIN</strong></p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p><p>Concerning three-point bending, the failures forces were satisfactory. The same issue remained with being unable to pass the energy absorption rule for the Side Impact Structure because the panels were still not deflecting enough, even though Method 2 manufacturing helped the panels deflect more. <strong>WIN/LOSS</strong></p><p>Additionally, the new manufacturing method greatly reduced the risk of delamination, as more panels were failing due to ply failure which resulted in higher failure loads, panel stiffnesses and Modulus of Elasticities which were converging to the predictive results using Matlab and ANSYS. <strong>WIN</strong></p><p>Regarding perimeter shear the results were like method 1. <strong>WIN</strong></p><p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p><p>In the future it was decided to decrease the thickness of the core in order to get more deflection out of a panel to 1/2”. Decreasing the thickness of the core results in a less stiff panel allowing for more deflection before failure. One thing to note is that the failure forces will be lower than with the 1” core, therefore it will be inevitable to add more plies on the sandwich panel in order to bring up the failure force if ever the energy absorption of the panel is lower than the desired value despite a major increase in deflection.</p><p>New SES regulation also means that less unidirectional carbon can be used in a layup schedule. As a result, the woven carbon used should have a high ultimate tensile strength so that the layup schedule does not depend on the use of unidirectional carbon to support it.</p><p><strong>Spring 2020</strong></p><p>The carbon used was Unidirectional Grafil TR 50S and Woven T300 2x2 3k.

The main objective with this method would be to prevent delamination from occurring at a much more consistent rate.</p><p><strong>Objectives</strong></p><p>With the current carbon, we do not expect to meet SES rules unless an excessive number of plies are used because we cannot put as much unidirectional carbon as before.</p><p>The purpose of the panels is to further validate the Ansys and Matlab code predictions such that we can input the material properties of a stronger carbon, which would be used to pass SES with, and predict a loading curve, E, k, and a failure force. Ultimately, this prediction would be compared with the SES requirements to see if we pass the rules.</p><p><strong>Results and Testing</strong>:</p><p>To begin with, both 8-ply panels delaminated after a displacement of approximately 9 mm. The 2-ply panel failed due to ply failure after a displacement of approximately 12 mm and the unidirectional panels also failed due to ply failure after being displaced approximately 16 mm. The primary reason for switching to a half inch core was so that the panels could be displaced to a further extent before failing. The testing results suggest that the panel displacement did increase a significant amount compared to the one-inch core panels. While the displacement of the panels increased, the failure force of the panels decreased, which was expected because half inch core panels are less stiff than one-inch core panels. However, regarding the energy absorption of a panel, the energy is linearly proportional to the failure force of a panel and proportional to the square of the displacement of a panel. Therefore, the increase in displacement of the panels outweighed the loss in failure force regarding energy absorption. <strong>WIN</strong></p><p>Moving onto the predictions of the Young’s Modulus and Stiffness of the panels, ANSYS and Matlab proved to have a lot of error regarding the properties of the unidirectional panels. The predicted E and k values were much greater than the experimental values. Since the panels did not delaminate, it was hard to determine the cause for such discrepancies. Firstly, during the layup process, the unidirectional carbon is only covered on one side. As a result, when stacking the carbon on top of each other, small residue could possibly stack up into the laminates, thus negatively affecting the material properties of the panel. Moreover, during the layup process, the unidirectional carbon may have formed small pleats, as each ply was laid on top of each other, due to the fragile nature of the carbon. In the future it would be recommended to test the same unidirectional layups and ensure that the layup process is carried out with maximum attention to detail. <strong>LOSS</strong></p><p>Regarding the manufacturing process, the three-step cure did not seem to help the panels from failing due to delamination as expected. The three woven ply layup schedules were cured in three steps, whereas the unidirectional carbon layup schedules were cured in one step. As a result, the next step the team may want to explore to reduce the risks of delamination include using an autoclave to increase the pressure applied on the plies during the curing process. The CMSC has a small autoclave that would be big enough to cure test panels using small metal plates. Furthermore, the team may want to consider changing to a higher resin content film adhesive. Finally, increasing the debulking times of the panels, especially for the woven panels, should prove beneficial for reducing the risk of delamination. <strong>LOSS</strong></p><p>The purpose of using the same layup schedules as previously tested panels for the perimeter shear panels was to find out whether the core thickness had an impact on the perimeter shear failure force. The force vs displacement curves of the panels had the two expected peaks, representing the top and bottom laminates of the panel. When comparing the half inch core results with the one-inch core results, it seemed that the perimeter shear failure force was independent of the thickness of the core. As expected, the major factor in the perimeter failure force was the number of plies in the layup schedule. <strong>WIN</strong></p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong>:</p><p>In the future, it would be necessary to purchase or get stronger carbon donated to the team to pursue layup schedules capable of passing SES whilst keeping optimizing the weight of the chassis. From the testing that has been done in the past, it seems that obtaining a newer carbon with the same Young’s Modulus as T300 2x2 Twill but with a higher ultimate tensile strength is the best option to choose moving forwards. Furthermore, it would be recommended to switch to a denser core. A denser core increases the crush strength of the sandwich panel thus allowing the panel to deflect more and increase the failure force of the panel.</p>
