<h2 id="FrameArchitecture-Typesofchassis">Types of chassis</h2><h3 id="FrameArchitecture-1-LadderFrame">1 - Ladder Frame</h3><p>The history of the ladder frame chassis dates back to the times of the horse-drawn carriage. It was used for the construction of ‘body on chassis’ vehicles, which meant a separately constructed body was mounted on a rolling chassis. The chassis consisted of two parallel beams mounted down each side of the car where the front and rear axles were leaf-sprung beam axles. The beams were mainly channel sections with lateral cross members, hence the name. The main factor influencing the design was resistance to bending but there was no consideration of torsional stiffness.</p><p>A ladder frame acts as a grillage structure with the beams resisting the shear forces and bending loads. To increase the torsional stiffness of the ladder chassis cruciform bracing was added in the 1930s. The torque in the chassis is reacted by placing the cruciform members in bending, although the connections between the beams and the cruciform must be rigid. Ladder frames were used in car construction until the 1950s but in racing only until the mid 1930’s [Ref. 2]. A typical ladder frame is shown below in Fig. 1. </p><p><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper image-center-wrapper confluence-embedded-manual-size"><img class="confluence-embedded-image image-center" draggable="false" height="154" src="attachments/265095831/267658893.png" data-image-src="attachments/265095831/267658893.png" data-unresolved-comment-count="0" data-linked-resource-id="267658893" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="attachment" data-linked-resource-default-alias="image-2023-7-28_0-59-31.png" data-base-url="https://wiki.itap.purdue.edu" data-linked-resource-content-type="image/png" data-linked-resource-container-id="265095831" data-linked-resource-container-version="3" alt=""></span></p><h3 id="FrameArchitecture-2-Twintube">2 - Twin tube </h3><p>The ladder frame chassis became obsolete in the mid-1930s with the advent of all-around independent suspension, pioneered by Mercedes Benz and Auto Union. <strong>The suspension was unable to operate effectively due to the lack of torsional stiffness.</strong> The ladder frame was modified to overcome these failings by <strong>making the side rails deeper and boxing them</strong>. A closed section has approximately one thousand times the torsional stiffness of an open section. Mercedes initially chose a rectangular section, later switching to an oval section, which has high torsional stiffness and high bending stiffness due to increased section depth, while Auto Union used a tubular section. The original Mercedes design was further improved by mounting the cross members through the side rails and welding on both sides. The efficiency of twin tube chassis’ is usually low due to the weight of the large tubes. They were still in use into the 1950s, the 1958 Lister-Jaguar being an example of this type [Ref. 1]. A typical twin-tube chassis is shown in Fig. 2 </p></div>

<h3 id="FrameArchitecture-3-Fourtube">3 - Four tube</h3><p>As designers sought to improve the bending stiffness of a chassis, the twin-tube chassis evolved into the four-tube chassis. The original twin tube design was modified by adding two more longitudinal tubes that ran from the front of the car, around the cockpit opening, and onto the rear of the car. The top and bottom side rails are connected by vertical or diagonal members, essentially creating a very deep side rail and thus improving the bending characteristics. The two sides are joined by a <strong>series of bulkheads</strong>, normally located at the front, footwells, dash area, seatback, and rear of the chassis. [Ref.1]</p><p>A significant increase in bending stiffness was realized but there is little increase in the torsional stiffness due to the lack of triangulation causing lozenging of the bays.</p></div>

<h3 id="FrameArchitecture-4-Backbone">4 - Backbone</h3><p>The backbone chassis has a long history in automobile design with its origins credited to Hans Ledwinka, an engineer with Czech automaker Tatra. Ferdinand Porsche worked with Ledwinka in the 1920s and arguably learned much of his craft from him [Ref. 1]. When a chassis derives its torsional stiffness from one large central tube running the length of the car, the resistance to twisting depends almost entirely on the cross-sectional area of that tube. Clearly, that cross-section can be much larger than the typical driveshaft tunnel. Depending on the vehicle configuration it is possible to arrange for an approximately rectangular tube of substantial dimensions. This arrangement fits in well with conventional side-by-side seating, with the large central spine forming a center console. Such an arrangement was utilized by Colin Chapman on the Lotus Elan (Fig. 4) of 1962-1973 [Ref. 1].</p><p><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper image-center-wrapper confluence-embedded-manual-size"><img class="confluence-embedded-image confluence-thumbnail image-center" draggable="false" height="250" src="attachments/265095831/267658908.png" data-image-src="attachments/265095831/267658908.png" data-unresolved-comment-count="0" data-linked-resource-id="267658908" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="attachment" data-linked-resource-default-alias="image-2023-7-28_1-33-50.png" data-base-url="https://wiki.itap.purdue.edu" data-linked-resource-content-type="image/png" data-linked-resource-container-id="265095831" data-linked-resource-container-version="3" alt=""></span></p></div>

<h3 id="FrameArchitecture-5-Spaceframe">5 - Spaceframe</h3><p>Although the spaceframe demonstrated a logical development of the four-tube chassis, the space frame differs in several key areas and offers enormous advantages over its predecessors. A spaceframe is one in which many straight tubes are arranged so that the loads experienced all act in either tension or compression. This is a major advantage since none of the tubes are subject to a bending load. Since space frames are inherently stiff in torsion, very little material is needed so they can be lightweight. The growing realization of the need for increased chassis torsional stiffness in the years following World War II led to the space frame, or a variation of it, becoming universal among European road race cars following its appearance on both the Lotus Mk IV [Fig.5] and the Mercedes 300 SL in 1952 [Ref. 1]. While these cars were not strictly the first to use space frames, they were widely successful, and the attention they received popularised the idea.</p><p><br/></p></div>
