update fast enough → It is best to use WSS and use the GPS to check that data</span></li></ul></li><li><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);">To measure tire circumference mark the ground and tire then do a

fastest is the best option: &quot;<em>The advantages in accuracy from averaging do not outweigh the reliability and consistency of selecting the fastest</em></span></li></ul></li><li>Corrected Speed (Corr Speed) is where MoTeC makes use of the IMU to correct for total lockup for the most accurate speed measurement possible</li><li>GPS have a time delay associated with them being logged, a correction factor is necessary in i2 to offset this</li><li>Be aware of whether Time or Distance is on the x-axis as distance will distort the image and not show portions where vehicle speed is 0</li><li>When comparing two laps they should be stretched/shrunk to the same distance (not including out/in laps they will never line up as the variation is too large)<ul><li>To check this is the case make sure minimum cornering speeds line up position-wise</li></ul></li><li>Transition of tire contact patch from static to kinetic friction is called sliding in cornering, slip in acceleration, and lockup during braking</li><li>Small and repeated lockups of a given set of tires (F/R) typically indicate a brake bias problem</li><li>During acceleration rolling circumference decreases significantly, slightly offsetting the wheel speed measurement</li><li>Limited slip differential allows for lockup during acceleration and open diff during cornering</li><li>The most speed can be gained by improving high-speed corners</li></ul><p><br/></p><p><strong>Chapter 3: RPM</strong></p><ul><li>For engine-related channels, an x-axis of time is preferred to distance so that times when the car is not moving do not disappear</li><li>Heat soak occurs when coolant, oil, etc. is heated while the car is stopped and higher temperatures are read across temperature sensors</li><li>Clutch slip can give the appearance of traction control problems in the RPM trace → Verify wheel slippage with wheel speed sensor readings</li><li>The RPM trace can provide better insight into slight speed variations between two drivers or laps</li><li>Over Rev = Any time the engine RPM goes above its intended limit<ul><li>Typically caused by a damaged part</li></ul></li><li>Put a horizontal line on the RMP limit in the RPM channel</li><li>X-Y Plot of RPM vs. Speed can help show if the driver is always shifting when they should<br/><ul><li>Overlap at 100% throttle can be caused by incorrect shift timing, short-shifting to save fuel, or for a cornering-specific reason</li></ul></li><li>It is easier to find optimal shift points using horsepower (save the calculation to it)</li></ul><p>

accelerates faster in the lowest possible gear for any given speed<ul><li>Exceptions to this are:<ul><li>Driver trying to save fuel by driving at a lower RPM</li><li>Certain corners can be taken faster in a higher gear as the car is less sensitive to throttle input</li><li>Downshifts can delay braking and upshifts can delay acceleration (time gains due to gear change must outweigh the time lost during the gear change)</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><p><br/></p><p><strong>Chapter 5: Throttle</strong></p><ul><li>Throttle position is best shown as a percentage of maximum</li><li>The goal of throttle blipping is to match the engine revs required for the next lower gear<ul><li>Reduces the impact of letting the clutch out a makes it possible to downshift without the clutch</li></ul></li><li>Time between throttle blips should be longer for each consecutive downshift (greater difference between gear ratios)</li><li>Amount of throttle blip should increase for each consecutive downshift (greater difference in RPM with greater difference between gear ratios)</li><li>Over Run Fuel Cut = Stopping fuel injection when only the car's momentum is keeping the engine turning</li><li>Downshift throttle blipping should have no effect on brake pressure</li><li>Generally, constant radius corners are best suited for steady throttle and changing radius/banking ones are best taken with multiple lifts</li><li>There should be no throttle lifts on corner exit</li><li>Throttle position trace should be smooth (minimal handling upset)</li><li>Balanced Throttle = The small amount of throttle that keeps the car at constant speed (for max traction)</li><li>End of Corner Exit = Point where engine power is not strong enough to cause rear wheel slippage such that there is no concern that WOT will exceed the grip level of the drive tires</li><li>Cross-sectional area of throttle increases rapidly in the beginning (&lt;30%) and falls off towards WOT (&gt;60%)</li></ul><p><br/></p><p><strong>Chapter 6: G Force</strong></p><ul><li>Accelerometer data must be filtered due to many small vibrations transmitted through the chassis</li><li>Stiffer chassis (ie. monocoque) will transfer more vibration through them</li><li>There are three ways to filter an accelerometer:<ul><li>Low pass filter built into the sensor that filters the channel before it gets to the logger (increases delay and decreases resolution)</li><li>Anti-alias filter done by the logger in real time → Reads the sensor at a fast rate and applies a center-weighted average filter then logs at a slower rate (Requires more processing power and creates time delay equal to half the logging rate)</li><li>Filter applied in the analysis program (Requires very high logging rates up to 60000Hz)</li></ul></li><li>G-Force Long can be used to see braking points by noticing a drop</li><li>Stiff suspension transfers weight more quickly (quick application of brakes with soft springs will lockup fronts before weight has transferred)</li><li>Turn in point can be found by looking at G Force Lat (should be near 0 along a straight)</li><li>G-G plot's largest use is showing the driver's trail braking skill graphically</li><li>It is helpful to color the dots of a G-G plot by speed for cars with high downforce</li></ul><p><br/></p><p><strong>Chapter 7: Steering</strong></p><ul><li>Steering angle pos/neg should be the same as G Force Lat (+ left)</li><li>Steered angle should measure the angle of the outside tire (most steering is transmitted through the outside)</li><li>Radius of a corner can be calculated using speed and steered angle</li><li>Increased steering in an attempt to counter oversteer simply decreases the grip on the front tires and makes the situation worse (already on the decline of the tire traction curve)</li><li>Oversteer is indicated by a reduction in steering angle or a reversal of steering direction</li><li>Detecting oversteer requires an analysis of the equation G Force Lat = Speed x Speed x (tan(Steered Angle) / (-1 x Wheelbase))<ul><li>If Speed increases so must G Force Lat unless Steered Angle is decreased</li><li>If Steered Angle Increases so must G Force Lat unless Speed is decreased<ul><li><em>An increase in steering angle should be accompanied by an increase in G Force Lat, anywhere this is not the case the car experiences understeer so long as speed is not decreasing</em></li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Steering reference laps are the quickest way to spot oversteer/understeer (major differences in steering angle between the traces are indications)</li></ul><p><br/></p><p><strong>Chapter 9: Section Timing</strong></p><ul><li>The fastest rolling minimum lap is the fastest lap if the start/finish line could be moved anywhere</li><li>The fastest theoretical lap (eclectic) is essentially an SAT super-score for lap times but is often not possible because of the influence different sections of a track have on each other<ul><li>Made possible by grouping parts that influence each other into larger single sections</li><li>Useful when there is traffic to get an idea of what a good lap time could be</li></ul></li><li>Within the section timing chart sections should be color-coded by how close they are to the fastest completion time for that section</li></ul>
