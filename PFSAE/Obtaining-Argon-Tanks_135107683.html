                    <p>Article originally created by Michael Tam</p><p><br/></p><p>The argon for our welder comes from the university- there are enough research and academic projects consuming different hazardous or hard-to-store gases and materials that the university has an entire department dedicated to managing and distributing these resources around campus (Materials Management and Distribution Center- MMDC). As a university organization, we can ask for some of those resources and are subject to their rules. For us, this means that we are essentially just renting the tanks from the university at a reduced cost and do not have to deal with the logistics of driving the tank(s) anywhere. </p><p><strong>Tank Cost Math</strong></p><p><strong>            </strong>There is a one-time charge for ordering gas and a recurring monthly charge for tank rental (as long as the tank is in our possession). The one-time charge is incurred for every gas order.s</p><p><strong>Contacting BOSO</strong></p><p>BOSO handles the ordering details for the tanks- we are a part of the university and technically don’t have financial rights. The order also needs to be approved by an officer [of our club], so it’s much easier to just have either the current president or treasurer send in the order. Badger them about emailing BOSO and tell them to include the following information:</p><p>-        Number of cylinders needed</p><p>-        Destination, include building and room (ME G052, unless we’ve moved)</p><p>-        Addressee (that’s you, buddy)</p><p>This is our the person to contact about ordering the gas:</p><p> </p><p>Claudette Thompson:</p><p>-                    Email:               <a class="external-link" href="mailto:chthompson@purdue.edu" rel="nofollow">chthompson@purdue.edu</a> - this lady retired, emailing boso directly until they give us a new contact</p><p> </p><p>If the shop is no longer in ME, check to make sure that the MMDC delivers to the new building. The cylinder drop-off and pick up location need certain safety equipment to handle tanks (such as chains and anchors to keep them upright). Otherwise, tanks should arrive within a few days after they are ordered.</p><p><strong>Transporting Tanks</strong></p><p><strong>            </strong>These tanks are rather heavy and hard to maneuver; they need to be in order to withstand the amount of pressure they go through. Try to keep the tanks anchored to a sturdy object with chains, and only transport tanks with dedicated cylinder carts. In ME, the carts can be found over in the airlock to the loading dock. The loading dock itself has an area for holding tanks for delivery and pickup. If you are returning a tank, mark it down on the form on the left of the overhead door in the airlock. </p>
