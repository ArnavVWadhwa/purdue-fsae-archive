                    <p><strong><span style="color: rgb(73,73,73);">Describe the equipment in which you are applying for puchasing</span></strong></p><p><span style="color: rgb(73,73,73);">We're applying to purchase equipment necessary for successful vehicle development and operation. This includes tools in sensors to be used on our 2024 vehicle and reused in future years. The sensors will be used to validate car performance, a crucial step in the design cycle and our member's learning. The tools will be used in the manufacturing and assembly of the team's car. The team builds a new car every year and has ample need for tools. The engine dyno components will be used to assemble the engine dyno, which with then be used for powertrain development.</span></p><p><strong><span style="color: rgb(73,73,73);">What is the purpose of the equipment?</span></strong></p><p><span style="color: rgb(73,73,73);">The equipment will be used to assemble the car, acquire data, and operate the vehicle. Use of this equipment also furthers members' professional and technical development, as it creates exposure to new technologies, provides a hands-on experience, and creates a technical learning opportunity. Appropriate tools, sensors, and components are critical to the development of a competitive car and vital to the learning experience provided to the club's members. Much of the team's budget goes towards components for the car and we're seeking additional funding to by the sensors and tools that would allow our team to efficiently build a car and validate our design.Â </span></p><p><strong><span style="color: rgb(73,73,73);">Where will the equipment be stored?</span></strong></p><p><span style="color: rgb(73,73,73);">The equipment will be stored in the team's shop on 3330 Klondike Road. The team uses the space to store tools and assemble the car. The team's engine dyno and vehicle is also stored in the shop.</span></p><p><strong><span style="color: rgb(73,73,73);">Who is responsible for the management of the equipment (secure storage, checking in/out equipment for org needs, etc)</span></strong></p><p><span style="color: rgb(73,73,73);">The team leadership will be responsible for management of the equipment. This includes the president Helen Rumsey, chief engineer, treasurer, and team leads.</span></p><p><strong><span style="color: rgb(73,73,73);">What is your storage plan for the equipment, if you receive the grant to purchase it? How often will the equipment be removed from the storage location?</span></strong></p><p><span style="color: rgb(73,73,73);">All equipment will be stored in the team's shop. Sensors will be installed on the car for data acquisition during testing. Most will permanently stay on the car until competition but will be reused to following year for the next car. Other tools and sensors will be used as needed for assembly of the car. They'll be stored in cabinets and drawers for easy access. Sensors will be used weekly for car testing and tools have the potential to be used daily depending on their use. The requested equipment will be utilized for many years to come until it's reached the appropriate lifecycle.</span></p><p><strong><span style="color: rgb(73,73,73);">Who will have access to the equipment?</span></strong></p><p><span style="color: rgb(73,73,73);">Any team member with shop access and a need to use the equipment will have the ability to access and use it.</span></p><p><br/></p><p><strong><span style="color: rgb(73,73,73);">Budget</span></strong><span style="color: rgb(73,73,73);"> (screenshot is post approval)</span></p><p><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper confluence-embedded-manual-size"><img class="confluence-embedded-image" draggable="false" height="400" src="attachments/276628754/279216986.png" data-image-src="attachments/276628754/279216986.png" data-unresolved-comment-count="0" data-linked-resource-id="279216986" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="attachment" data-linked-resource-default-alias="image-2023-11-13_15-3-32.png" data-base-url="https://wiki.itap.purdue.edu" data-linked-resource-content-type="image/png" data-linked-resource-container-id="276628754" data-linked-resource-container-version="3" alt=""></span></p><p><br/></p><p><strong><span style="color: rgb(73,73,73);">Reminders/ Comments</span></strong></p><ul><li>Email proof of storage before submitting application (previous year we just copied Todd and he gave a verbal proof of storage)</li><li>Request as close to $5000 as you can, it's likely they'll give you a set % of what you request (Fall 2023 it was 10%)</li><li>Once approved, any line item with a value greater than $0 is approved and can be purchased (Fall 2023 everything was approved but we were only allocated $500)</li><li>Either the treasurer or president must fill out the request.
