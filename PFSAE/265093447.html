                    <p><u><strong>Wingtip Wake</strong></u></p><p>This is a hard problem to solve. How you localize the wing tip wake plays a huge role on front wing performance and undertray performance. Outwashing this wake as much as possible will help reduce inboard tire wake downstream, which undertray really likes. But controlling this wake is hard. I have been using strakes. The problem with the strakes is that they create massive amounts of wake themselves, so you are essentially discretizing the wake by bringing some of the wake inboard, which is bad. We want the wake to be as outboard as possible. Then you might say just have strakes near the chassis for inboard pressurization, but then strakes near the chassis will produce too much losses for undertray to be happy. So yes, better solution for this region is needed.</p><p><strong><u>Outwashing Winglet</u></strong></p><p>I got rid of it for yaw sensitivity reasons. But I think it can be reintroduced by mounting it close to the nosecone. Since nosecone provides a nice curvature for flow attachment on the downwind side while providing a large area for pressurization on the upwind side, the relative angle between the two side are actually very similar. In that kind of environment you can run something vertical without worrying about separation. Also, even if the inboard does want to separate, it will have a hard time doing so since it's so close to a area with very high pressure, which suppresses separation.</p><p><u><strong>Tire Wake Suppressor</strong></u></p><p>Need more optimization. Maybe longer span and chord if you can afford trading away more downforce. Maybe turn the wing tip of the suppressor 90 deg for more physical outwash. Maybe something else. Anyways, as I said before, the more outwash you can get on this, the happier undertray is going to be with less tire wake ingestion and less inwash.</p><p><u><strong>Flow Conditioners</strong></u></p><p>Work on it. I never touched them since I first CADed it. They are pretty un-ideal at the moment. You should trend toward a flapped setup. But you need to find more downforce so you are do that. Think about element orientation and sizing to minimize drag and lift.</p><p><u><strong>Outwash Profile</strong></u></p><p>Right now I have the tip outwash profile flaring out. There is no real reason to do it. So try without it, the result should be better.</p><p><u><strong>Vortex Channel (or a simple plate)</strong></u></p><p>I found more performance by switch to a simple plate by eliminating VC wake. To reduce wake further, this plate can be made to be aligned with the flow. Expect strake and endplate vortices to get much stronger and potentially bursting faster (although this is probably not gonna happen to the inner most vortex so that's why I think this is good).</p>
