                    <p>Early considerations:</p><ul><li>Wheel assembly design:<ul><li>Being dependent on custom wheel centers that we cannot make in house doesn't seem wise looking back.</li><li>Switching to the 16 inch tires would probably make sense at some point, but there are not a lot of point on the table for it</li><li>Purchased wheel options are limited:<ul><li>OZ: expensive and reddit indicates there are supply issues. Also, only choice is magnesium wheels that are probably big expensive. However, customer service would likely be good and upfront. The only option is center lock however, which creates some extra analysis pain.</li><li>Keizer: there are horror stories about their customer service on reddit. Their wheel shells may be passable, but wheel centers seem worth avoiding.</li><li>Braid: an unknown, but possibly good. Seems like a professional company at the very least. They also provide center lock and lug options</li><li>There are other options out there you can find by looking for micro-sprint wheels. Looks like these would be tough because most are not designed with space for brake discs.</li></ul></li><li>What the big brains do:<ul><li>Stuttgart: custom center with wheel shells</li><li>Michigan: throws money at the OZs</li><li>San Jose State: custom centers</li><li>Cornell: custom centers</li></ul></li><li>Options:<ul><li>Buy braid wheels</li><li>Buy OZ wheels</li><li>Change custom wheel center design to more machinable form</li><li>Just stick with what we've got now</li></ul></li><li>Current decision:<ul><li>Go to simple wheel center design that we can make in house. This one (from stuttgart) is likely lighter and easier to machine than ours:<ul><li><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper confluence-embedded-manual-size"><img class="confluence-embedded-image" draggable="false" height="250" src="attachments/141728375/143757576.png" data-image-src="attachments/141728375/143757576.png" data-unresolved-comment-count="0" data-linked-resource-id="143757576" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="attachment" data-linked-resource-default-alias="image2020-4-6_17-37-10.png" data-base-url="https://wiki.itap.purdue.edu" data-linked-resource-content-type="image/png" data-linked-resource-container-id="141728375" data-linked-resource-container-version="4" alt=""></span></li></ul></li><li>Stick with keizer wheel shells, or carbon ones if we have money to burn</li><li>Will add some complexity to hubs. Need separate mount for brake disc. But likely still in house doable. Probably do a quick check on if there's any way to get current hub design to work.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Steering rack:<ul><li>Only real options are Narrco and KAZ</li><li>Narrco seems to work pretty well, but supply issues were scary. Should probably just switch to KAZ, but would be a pain.</li><li>Would require modification to front upright. May be able to do this without needing to redo cam entirely. unsure.</li><li>Probably make this call based on trying to buy a narrco real early on. Not super interested in dealing with this, and is easier for someone to do down the line than a wheel center change</li></ul></li></ul>
