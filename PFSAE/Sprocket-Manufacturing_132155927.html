</p><h1 id="SprocketManufacturing-AcquireStock">Acquire Stock</h1><p>Our main supply of aluminum is from Alcoa. Ideally, we receive enough sprocket stock to create several &quot;blanks&quot; (stock with spline feature) so that we can create sprockets for a few years. 7055 aluminum is preferable in our application due to its tensile yield and ultimate strength over 7075 or 7050. The stock would ideally by cylindrical with a diameter of at least 9 inches to ensure that different sprocket sizes could still be machined from it. The stock could also be rectangular which is slightly more inconvenient.</p><h1 id="SprocketManufacturing-PrepStockforWireEDM">Prep Stock for Wire EDM</h1><p>The wire EDM process creates the spline feature. To do this, the stock provided for this step should be faced on both sides to ensure that the spline is perpendicular to both faces of the sprocket. If the spline isn't perpendicular, the sprocket would have some amount of wobble, which is obviously unwanted. To prepare the stock for EDM, the stock should be cut into slabs with a thickness greater than the actual sprocket, at least 0.25 inches wider depending on how straight the bandsaw used can cut. From here, both sides of the stock should be faced down to the nominal thickness of the sprocket. The length and width of the block can be machined to be machined to be 0.25 inch greater than the sprocket diameter, or if making several blanks for future years they can be made generally larger to accompany any sprocket size.</p><h1 id="SprocketManufacturing-WireEDMSplineFeature">Wire EDM Spline Feature</h1><p>The wire EDM process is done through one of our sponsors, so this step is mainly communicating with our sponsor and setting up a time to do the machining.</p><h1 id="SprocketManufacturing-TurnStocktoSprocketProfile">Turn Stock to Sprocket Profile</h1><p>After receiving the stock with the spline feature, it can be mounted into the sprocket jig and placed into the lathe to machine it to the correct profile. This includes machining the diameter down to slightly over the OD of the sprocket, and machining the hub lips on both ends of the sprocket. Be sure to use a dial indicater on the 3 jaw chuck to indicate the workpiece when flipping the sprocket over.</p><h1 id="SprocketManufacturing-CreateMastercamProgramandApprovewithJohn">Create Mastercam Program and Approve with John</h1><p>This step is fairly straightforward. John is pretty familiar with the sprocket manufacturing and so there shouldn't be much issue here. Be sure to reference the 2020 sprocket Mastercam for the settings John used. This will save John some headache of fixing all the parameters and will speed up the process. The files can be found here: Z:\2020\9_Technical\2_Machining\4_Drivetrain\Sprocket</p><h1 id="SprocketManufacturing-CNCMillTeethandCutouts">CNC Mill Teeth and Cutouts</h1><p>Again, fairly straightforward. John will be helping you out with this.</p>
