</p><p>POWERTRAIN</p><p>Judge: go more into depth on why you chose the single cylinder over the 4 cylinder. (Probing us to see our knowledge)</p><p>Answer: weight &amp; torque (previously mentioned), sound</p><p>Judge: probed more wanted us to speak on plenum size, etc. Probled us to talking about the intake strokes of the two different engines and the need for a single to have a larger plenum. &quot;Losing 5 points BUT you are getting away from single cylinder problems such as throttle response due to the single's larger plenum.&quot; </p><p><br/></p><p>Judge: Why do you change first fuel vs. spark when tuning?</p><p>Answer: fuel is much safer to change, running rich = safer</p><p>Judge: plan on going forward = actually run the dyno. Going for a flat torque curve makes the car much easier to drive. Need to take into account driver skill in choices. Spring loaded slip on design to test different runner lengths to make sure our models are correct. </p><p><br/></p><p>DRIVETRAIN</p><p>Judge: &quot;Minimize shifts because you are not Schumacher.&quot; (Happy about 2018 torque curves) Need to count shifts (matters much more than one would think) Make the car for the driver.</p><p><br/></p><p>Judge: how did you set the load on uprights / sprocket? Did you take into account crankshaft rotation? </p><p>Answer: 2 ways, either by engine or tires. Engine should take into account spikes in torque due to crankshaft rotation. Tire slippage is why it will probably never actually break in competition.</p><p><br/></p><p>Judge: if you doubled the moment of inertia on the sprocket how many points would that cost you? Need to take into account how a risk like lightening the sprocket actually affects points. Risk vs. Reward.</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>OVERALL</p><p>judge liked it &quot;Overall approach was excellent&quot;  thought we actually used our dyno a lot RIP lmao</p><p><br/></p><p>&quot;3 legged stool&quot;</p><ol><li>tribal knowledge = great</li><li>testing = great</li><li>models = need improvement</li></ol><p>need to incorporate dyno into models</p><p>i.e. hemholtz, 1d models, test differences</p><p><br/></p><p>really liked exhaust collector size, need to prove it works</p><p><br/></p><h3 id="PowertrainandDrivetrainPresentationNotes-Hereisthepracticepresentation,thisshouldgiveyouagoodideaofwhatwasactuallypresented.">Here is the practice presentation, this should give you a good idea of what was actually presented.</h3><p><iframe class="youtube-player" type="text/html" style="width: 400px; height: 300px"
