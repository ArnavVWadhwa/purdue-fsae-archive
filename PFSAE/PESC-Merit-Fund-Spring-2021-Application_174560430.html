                    <ul><li><strong><span style="color: rgb(32,33,36);">Please provide your Organization's Mission Statement or overarching purpose of your Organization at Purdue University</span></strong><ul><li><span style="color: rgb(32,33,36);"><span style="color: rgb(23,43,77);">Members of the Purdue Formula SAE team create a new well-designed car each year by combining the theory learned in class with hands-on skills. Students utilize engineering skills and state-of-the-art tools to manufacture and validate the new car. Our team is comprised primarily of mechanical engineering students, but we also welcome students from other majors. Purdue FSAE is first and foremost a team. Our team spends an enormous amount of time together throughout the school year which helps us work together effectively. We collaborate to find new ways to combine our wide array of engineering talents and experiences to build and design a unique race car. At the end of the school year in May, our members compete with our vehicle at the Michigan International Speedway against 100 international universities. Our goal is to excel in vehicle design and maneuverability on track with a top 10 finish in our competition.</span></span></li></ul></li><li><strong><span style="color: rgb(32,33,36);">Amount of funding requested</span></strong><ul><li><span style="color: rgb(32,33,36);">$1700</span></li></ul></li><li><strong><span style="color: rgb(32,33,36);">How does this expenditure/event/project contribute to your mission statement or the overarching purpose of your organization?</span></strong><ul><li><span style="color: rgb(32,33,36);">The acquisition of the Single Cylinder WR450f engine will allow us to go ahead and build PF22, the car we researched and designed in Fall 2020 and Spring 2021 for the FSAE 2022 Competition as we will be able to use this engine on our custom <span style="color: rgb(34,34,34);">dynamometer (Dyno for short) which will allow us to test and optimize our competition car to achieve the goal of a top ten finish in SAE Michigan. Besides this, we will also be able to help our younger members become more familiar with the Dyno and engines themselves as they are able to work with and tinker on this engine while we have our main engine in the car.</span></span></li><li><span style="color: rgb(32,33,36);"><span style="color: rgb(34,34,34);">The requested funding would be for purchasing a WR450f engine which our team has designed a car around for the 2022 competition. This is a new engine that we have decided to switch to, as we expect it to yield us greater competition performance to help us reach a top 10 finish in competition. To fully validate the assumptions made to determine that the WR450f engine would yield greater performance in competition, dyno testing must be done to obtain the engine torque curve and other performance parameters. We currently own one WR450f engine for use on our engine dyno, however, we would like to acquire another one for our 2022 vehicle and as a backup for our engine dyno. The second engine will ensure that we can complete any necessary engine testing and tuning on our dyno should the first one have an unexpected failure. If no failure of the first engine occurs, this second WR450f engine will go into the 2022 vehicle.</span></span></li></ul></li><li><strong><span style="color: rgb(32,33,36);">Please describe who is directly impacted by this event and how they will benefit from participating</span></strong><ul><li><span style="color: rgb(32,33,36);">Our team is directly impacted by this funding request. By receiving this funding for a second engine, we can ensure that engine testing and tuning can be done on our new WR450f engine, as it can serve as a backup in case of a failure of the first WR450f engine. The testing and tuning data will be used to evaluate if the decision to switch engines will yield greater performance. Additionally, our team can begin building the 2022 vehicle earlier since this second engine would be designated for the 2022 vehicle provided no issues arise on the engine dyno.</span></li></ul></li><li><strong><span style="color: rgb(32,33,36);">If you receive funding but this event is canceled due to unforeseen circumstances, how would you utilize the extra resources?</span></strong><ul><li><span style="color: rgb(32,33,36);">If SAE Michigan is canceled then we will still have the same usage of these funds as we will buy the WR450f and test the engine to enhance our Competition Car's performance.</span></li><li><span style="color: rgb(32,33,36);">If our competition is canceled or we are unable to attend then we will still be able to put these funds towards purchasing the WR450f engine, as this purchase is designated towards next year's success. The 2021 competition vehicle is already complete while the WR450f is for next season.</span></li></ul></li><li><strong><span style="color: rgb(32,33,36);">If this is a new event or project, how do you personally plan on measuring its success and impact? If this is not a new event or project, how will you compare the success of the event to when it has been run in previous years and highlight how you plan to continue to improve this event/project?</span></strong><ul><li><span style="color: rgb(32,33,36);">The impact of this purchase will be measured by the performance of the 2022 vehicle. Because this engine serves as the engine for the 2022 vehicle and as a backup for the dyno, having this second engine will ensure that we have redundancy in our dyno testing and in competition in case any issues arise. Success will be defined as being able to fully tune the engine, obtain a torque curve, and compete in the 2022 competition with the WR450f engine and achieve our goal of making top 10 overall in competition.</span></li></ul></li><li><strong><span style="color: rgb(32,33,36);">Describe any changes that will be made to the event/project to accommodate changing conditions stemming from the new Protect Purdue guidelines</span></strong><ul><li>Because this funding request is only to purchase a WR450f engine, no changes will need to be made to comply with the new Protect Purdue guidelines, as no in-person work is relevant for this.</li></ul></li><li><strong><span style="color: rgb(32,33,36);">If you do not receive funding, how will you continue to work on your expenditure/project/event?</span></strong><ul><li>If funding is not provided, the purchase of a second WR450f engine will likely be delayed for next season to ensure the team is able to cover all costs for the remainder of this season. Our team still has two competitions which we are planning to attend in the summer which will be bigger expenses and will be prioritized over purchasing the WR450f engine.</li></ul></li><li><strong><span style="color: rgb(32,33,36);">What other means of funding has your organization pursued specifically for this event? Are there currently funds already allocated to this event/project? If so, how much?</span></strong><ul><li><span style="color: rgb(32,33,36);">We have not allocated any funds already for purchasing the WR450f engine. However, we are actively seeking funding from companies to secure this purchase and to cover the remaining costs for this year.</span></li></ul></li><li><strong><span style="color: rgb(32,33,36);">If you received funding last semester, please elaborate on how that funding was used and the impact it had on your organization</span></strong><ul><li><span style="color: rgb(32,33,36);">We received $1300 from the Fall 2020 PESC Merit Fund. This funding was used to purchase two new dampers which have been installed onto our competition vehicle. These will positively impact our track and competition performance, as the new dampers have greater tunability and response from our old dampers which have had leaking issues in the past. We have not yet been able to take our vehicle to testing due to difficulties in securing testing locations, so we have not driven using the new dampers yet.</span></li></ul></li><li><strong><span style="color: rgb(32,33,36);">Please share anything that relates to your event which was funded by Merit Fund (files, photos, websites, etc.)</span></strong><ul><li><span style="color: rgb(32,33,36);">Ben sent me photos of the car with the new dampers on, I'll submit them here.</span></li></ul></li></ul>
