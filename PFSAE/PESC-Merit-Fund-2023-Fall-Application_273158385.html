(Max 300 words)</span></strong></p><p>Tire testing is a crucial part in validating vehicle design and developing a competitive racecar. With two sets of tires, strain gauges, and IR temperature sensors we would be able to study the difference between two different tire compounds. We will be able to analyze the difference in lap time, accelerations, tire temperatures, and vehicle response to driver controls. This will provide validation and justification into which compound is better for our application and results in the fastest car. At the same time we will have data on the suspension loads for both tires and can validate our model used for determining limit loads for structural design. The same suspension loading data can be used to evaluate response times of front to rear axle based upon how forces develop with time during a steering input, providing further information on vehicle dynamics and increasing our understanding of the car. This will be one of the best educational experiences the team has completed in many years.</p><p><br/></p><p><strong><span style="color: rgb(32,33,36);">What other means of funding has your organization pursued specifically for this event? Are there currently funds already allocated to this event/project? If so, how much?</span></strong></p><p><span style="color: rgb(32,33,36);">The team has used previous Merit Fund money to purchase strain gauges (key for load validation), but is requesting money for tire temperature sensors and tires to used specifically for tire testing. The team hasn't pursued other funding specifically for this testing. We do receive funding from a variety of companies, but that money is set aside for manufacturing and purchase of key components for the vehicle. Tire testing and comparison is a need to be a competitive team at competition, but not as big of a need as key car components like the driver's harness, roll-bar padding, clutch paddles, etc.</span></p><p><br/></p><p><strong><span style="color: rgb(32,33,36);">Should you have remaining funds from the grant after your event/project, in what ways would the extra resources be utilized? (Max 300 words)</span></strong></p><p><span style="color: rgb(32,33,36);">The remaining funds would be set aside for the purchase of additional sets of tires. In previous years we've purchased 6 sets of tires for a season, but quickly wear through them which dramatically effects car performance and handling. Compromised car performance effects our driver's confidence in the car, understanding of how the car handles, and data collection which then effects our performance at competition. Ideally we'd have 6 sets of tires designated for testing each year and 2 sets of tires for competition to maintain a competitive advantage.</span></p><p><br/></p><p><strong><span style="color: rgb(32,33,36);">What activity, characteristic, or project sets you apart from other clubs that may be applying? (Max 300 words)</span></strong></p><p><span style="color: rgb(32,33,36);">Being a part of Formula SAE is a unique opportunity to learn and get involved in a hands-on project. Our club iterates through the whole design cycle and provides students with the chance to get involved in design, analysis, manufacturing, and testing. The project challenges students to combine the theory learned in class with hands-on skills to create a new car each year. Not only do our members learn technical skills, but also teamwork, time management, and budgeting. Formula SAE tests nearly every aspect of being a engineer in industry and provides an experiential learning experience that sets our club apart from other Purdue clubs. </span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(32,33,36);">Students on Formula SAE have the chance to get involved in any of our subsystems (chassis, suspension, powertrain, aerodynamics, and electronics) depending on their interests. They utilize engineering excellence, including industry standard CAD, CAM, and FEA software and techniques, and modern manufacturing, like mills, welding, and CNC, to design nearly every component on the vehicle. We iterate on our design every year, with nearly 95% designed or modified by the team and 90% manufactured by students. This provides an invaluable learning experience and prepares our members to excel in an engineering career.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(32,33,36);">What sets Formula SAE apart is the scope and technical challenge of designing, building, and testing a new car each year. Members expand their technical and teamwork capabilities to become the next generation of great Purdue engineers. </span></p><p><br/></p><p><strong><span style="color: rgb(32,33,36);">What is something that your organization has accomplished that you are the most proud of? (Max 300 words)</span></strong></p><p>Our team is most proud of how competitive we've been in recent years, especially in the design event. Over the past three years we've placed 8th, 2nd, and 6th overall and 3rd, 2nd, and 2nd in the design event. The design event includes an initial presentation to industry specialists on our design decisions, justifications, and testing which is followed by a 3-hour final round where judges rotate and ask specialized questions on vehicle dynamics, drivetrain, team organization, etc. Doing well in the design event is a reflection of the team's understanding of their design and validation.</p><p>Our recent performance would not have been achievable without the improvements and additional testing that we've conducted over the years. These are valuable experiences that provide real data that can be used to influence and improve the next years design. Conducting testing like tire analysis and validation of suspension loads gives us a competitive advantage in the design event. Our goal is to push our limits of knowledge, achieve 1st place in the design event, and set the team up for future success. Tire testing and analysis is the next step in understanding and validating the vehicle dynamics of our car. </p><p><br/></p><p><strong><span style="color: rgb(32,33,36);">If you have received funding from Merit Fund in the past, please elaborate to the best of your ability about how that funding was used and the impact it had on your organization.</span></strong></p><p><span style="color: rgb(32,33,36);">Previous Merit Fund money has been used to purchase strain gauges and a team laptop. Both of these items are crucial to team success. The strain gauges are used to validate suspension loads, which can then be applied to the analysis of the suspension system and help the team better understand car performance. We're able to design lighter components, make a faster car, and perform better in the design event at competition. The team laptop is used primarily for data analysis and tuning during car testing. We're able to quickly make changes and review data. </span></p><p><br/></p><p><strong><span style="color: rgb(32,33,36);">Please share anything that relates to your event which was funded by Merit
