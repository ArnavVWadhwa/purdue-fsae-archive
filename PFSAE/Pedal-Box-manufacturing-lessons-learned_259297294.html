                    <p><u>Successes</u></p><ul><li>Weld prepped interlocking tabs.</li></ul><p>We used 0 tolerance and ground the tabs down manually. Ideally you should use a 1-5 thou tolerance. It will saveyou effort. This technique made welding much easier, yielding cleaner welds, and did not take much extra time to implement.</p><p><br/></p><p><u>Failures/mistakes</u></p><ul><li>Double sided throttle insert</li></ul><p>Do not make a long insert that attaches to bolts that turn in the same direction on both sides the insert is nearly impossible to unscrew.</p><p>This was done for the throttle pedal insert because the torsion springs were concentric with the throttle pedal. To avoid this, mount the springs on separate tabs in front of (nearer the front of the car) the throttle pedal instead and mount the springs and pedal all separately, all on BOLTS. Another advantage of this is that the material props and surface finish of bolts are much better than any steel or aluminum insert we can make.</p><p>If you must have a very long insert, use a left hand bolt on one side and a right hand bolt on the other. In this case, also plan on using a bushing. We want sliding with low tolerances.</p><ul><li>Â 0 tolerance throttle pedal back stop</li></ul><p>To keep the throttle pedal in place when not in use a horizontal rectangular tab was initially placed behind the throttle pedal.</p><p>The surface contacting the pedal was placed exactly where we needed the throttle pedal to stop. We did not consider that the throttle pedal would only ended up touching the bottom of the tab, twisting it, applying way more stress (bending/torsion) than expected. We ended up replacing the tab with a separate one which went further behind the pedal with the pedal contacting a bolt mounted on the new tab.</p><p>Serious thought needs to go into designing a better pedal backstop. We do not yet have a good solution for this!</p><ul><li>Corner of throttle cable guide touched a tube</li></ul><p>Triple check this! It looks very unprofessional to have a ground down throttle cable holder</p><ul><li>Loose/Vague throttle cable holder</li></ul><p>Make the holder out of relatively thick steel and tighten the bolts well. We don't want any play on the throttle cable holder.</p><p><br/></p>
