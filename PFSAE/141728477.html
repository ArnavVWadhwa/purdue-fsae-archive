The suspension team is tasked with making the vehicle architecture decisions and compromises that affect all other systems. Accordingly, and all around understanding of the car is a must. <em>Tune to Win </em>is the best start at that understanding. It also places emphasis on suspension analysis that will help start building the intuition required to make it through the math that comes in <em>Race Car Vehicle Dynamics</em>. The good news is <em>Tune to Win </em>is a short read. You can buy a hard copy for ~$20, or read the PDF in the above google drive folder.</p><p><br/></p><h1 id="Onboarding(Suspension)-Books/PresentationtoRead">Books / Presentation to Read</h1><h2 id="Onboarding(Suspension)-SuspensionKinematicsandVehicleDynamics">Suspension Kinematics and Vehicle Dynamics</h2><ul><li>After reading <em>Tune to Win:</em><ul><li>If you want a quick overview: read this page: <a href="Kinematics-and-Vehicle-Dynamics-Basics-For-FSAE_130157329.html">Kinematics and Vehicle Dynamics Basics For FSAE</a> <ul><li>It references <em>Race Car Vehicle Dynamics</em>, which can be found in google drive folder</li></ul></li><li>If you want to dive deep: <ul><li>read the tire slides from the Optimum G seminar: find in google drive folder</li><li>read <em>Race Car Vehicle Dynamics </em>in its entirety except for aero sections: find in google drive folder</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><h2 id="Onboarding(Suspension)-StructuresAnalysis">Structures Analysis</h2><ul><li>If you have not taken Mechanics of Material (ME 323 or aero / civil equivalent):<ul><li>Focus on vehicle dynamics until you take this class.

Most companies would also have other FEA packages. ANSYS is great for analyzing small individual components or assemblies where problem size is not an issue. For large systems, most companies would turn to a different package. It was the primary FEA package at Hendrickson; it was one of several used at SpaceX.</li><li>Any FEA setup includes a pre processor, solver, and post processor. ANSYS Workbench includes all three.
