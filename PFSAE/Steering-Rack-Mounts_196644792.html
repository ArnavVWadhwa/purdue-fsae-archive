This was due to strain in the bottom bearing support after welding (the bottom support jig was taken off during welding - just the last couple beads of welding were done out of jig), which caused the axial position of the column to twist and shift slightly. When trying to assemble the steering it was very tough to get the column in the adapter and when fastening the mounts the rack would go under a lot of stress. We iteratively placed washers under the mounts to try to match the steering rack axial position with that of the support. We found that one thick washer (0.063'') on the left support and two thick washers on the right support helped the axial position.</p><p><br/></p><p>We then remade the bottom supports to add the washer thicknesses and had to shorten the long steering column tube. Once the mounts were remade the assembly was able to come together easier and the rack was experiencing less stress than before remaking the mounts. The steering is still a little stiffer than before but this was our best option since we cant reweld.</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p>
