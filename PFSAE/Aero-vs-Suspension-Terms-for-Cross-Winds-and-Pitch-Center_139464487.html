                    <p>Aero will use the term &quot;yaw angle&quot; to discuss accounting for cross winds on the car. To suspension people, the word yaw generally refers to the car actually yawing as in being in a corner. This is only modeled by having the car actually going though a curved CFD wind tunnel (but is also reasonably well approximated by straight line). So when discussing accounting cross winds and / or cornering sims, just be sure to define terms clearly at the start. This caused a bit of confusing between in 2020.</p><p><br/></p><p>Another past confusion point was an aero request for pitch center. To a suspension person, this sounds like the kinematic pitch center created as a result of anti squat / anti dive geometry. What aero wanted was just the height at which center of drag is creating a moment on the car changing the balance. This height is always the center of drag to the ground. Suspension kinematics has nothing to do with it.</p>
