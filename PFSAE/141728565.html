                    <p>Tested with Savox SB2292SG.</p><p>Provided voltage makes a noticeable difference is speed and torque.</p><p>Was able to shift out of neutral to first or second. Not enough torque to shift out of second gear. Shifting in to higher gears seems to require more torque.</p><p>Would like to measure stall current. Was poorly measured, but seemed to be peaking at 3 amps, not ~10 amps as spec'd by savox<span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;"> </span></p><p><br/></p><p>Possible issues:</p><p>shift arm ratio, was tested with slightly shorter arm on servo, should have provided more torque?</p><p><br/></p><p>Maybe try a more powerful servo or cut losses on this project.</p><p>If continuing figure out speed specification for shifting, I believe servos are rated at no load for speed so a shifting load of 500+ oz-in could dramatically slow the shift.</p><p>Could look at Savox SB2290SG, roughly twice the torque and half the speed.</p><p>Or <a class="external-link" href="https://www.pololu.com/product/1391/specs" rel="nofollow">https://www.pololu.com/product/1391/specs</a> this thing is massive, the largest PWM controlled rc servo I could find. Can run on 12V, rated at 1600 oz-in, if you can't shift with this, give up and make it a push-pull cable. This looks like it will need a different mount.</p><p><br/></p><p>Notes: shifter mount was flexing, if continuing with this project the base plate will probably need more support</p>
