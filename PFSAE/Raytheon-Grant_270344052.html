Our vision is to represent the pinnacle of project-based undergraduate engineering at Purdue University through the SAE Collegiate Design Series by developing the abilities of team members to their maximum potential in engineering and team building. We do this through our mission to produce a consistently performing vehicle and foster a cohesive team; to drive our team into the Top 10 in every event, design finals, and win overall at the IC FSAE competition through justified engineering decisions and set the team up for continued success. Our mission guides not only the technical decisions we make on the team, like which engine we should use or suspension kinematics, but also our focus on new member recruitment and education. Our main goals are to set up the team for future success through education, documentation, culture, and recruitment and to continuously challenge ourselves technically while maintaining ethical decision making. The byproduct of these goals will be winning overall at competition. </span></p><p><br/></p><p><strong><span style="color: rgb(23,43,77);"><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);">Please upload your organization’s most recent Annual Reports.</span></span></strong></p><p><strong><span style="color: rgb(23,43,77);"><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);"><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper"><a class="confluence-embedded-file" href="/download/attachments/270344052/Purdue%20Formula%20SAE%20-%20Account%20Statement%20Individual.docx?version=1&amp;modificationDate=1694280246000&amp;api=v2" data-nice-type="Word Document" data-file-src="/download/attachments/270344052/Purdue%20Formula%20SAE%20-%20Account%20Statement%20Individual.docx?version=1&amp;modificationDate=1694280246000&amp;api=v2" data-linked-resource-id="270344057" data-linked-resource-type="attachment" data-linked-resource-container-id="270344052" data-linked-resource-default-alias="Purdue Formula SAE - Account Statement Individual.docx" data-mime-type="application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document" data-has-thumbnail="true" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-can-edit="true" aria-label="Purdue Formula SAE - Account Statement Individual.docx" draggable="false"><img src="rest/documentConversion/latest/conversion/thumbnail/270344057/1" height="250" alt="" draggable="false"/></a><span class="companion-edit-button-placeholder edit-button-overlay" data-linked-resource-container-id="270344052" data-linked-resource-id="270344057" data-template-name="companionEditIcon" data-source-location="embedded-attachment"></span></span></span></span></strong></p><p><br/></p><p style=""><strong><span class="fe_q_name" style="color: rgb(0,0,0);">Please provide a brief summary of your project or program and how the funds will be used.</span></strong><br/><strong><span class="lbl_help"><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Guidance</span>: Provide a brief description of the project for which you seek support, including the overall purpose of the project, use of our funds, total anticipated number of people or places to be served and geography served by the project. </em></span></strong></p><p style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);">Formula SAE (FSAE) is a student design competition endorsed by the Society of Automotive Engineers. Each year SAE International challenges students to design, build, and race a small open wheel car. </span><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);">The Formula SAE competition is designed to test each team’s knowledge of various aspects of vehicle design and manufacturing. Each year, student built cars are presented to members of industry who judge their engineering decisions and designs. These critiques help teams learn about and improve upon designs. The cars are also rigorously tested during dynamic events which evaluate drivability, reliability, and the overall performance of the car. Both static and dynamic events are used to determine a winner. </span></p><p style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);">Our team consists of 30-50 students who work together to build a new car each year by combining the theory learned in class with hands-on skills. The purpose is to build a fast car, understand the engineering behind it, and prepare our members to tackle big problems facing the engineering industry upon graduation. The funds will go towards the manufacturing of our 2024 vehicle. It's extremely expensive to build a new car each year, especially when our focus is education and we encourage members to think outside the box and try something new. Our vehicles tend to be similar, but not identical from year to year, meaning we have to buy many of the components each year. </span></p><p style="text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style=""><strong><span class="fe_q_name" style="color: rgb(0,0,0);">Please describe what makes your organization uniquely qualified to implement this program or project at this time.</span></strong><br/><strong><span class="lbl_help"><em>Limited to 500 characters.<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br/>Guidance</span>: Focus on ways you truly stand out and on how your strengths and past experience qualify you to successfully execute the project in this proposal.</em></span></strong></p><p><span>Purdue FSAE consistently performs in the Top 10 – a reflection of our work ethic and successful knowledge transfer. We’re one of the top SAE teams and top engineering clubs at Purdue. Students who want an education beyond their classes join our team and expand their technical knowledge. Additionally, we stand out from other SAE teams because we redesign each component every year. While reusing components may increase the chance of winning, we value the design and manufacturing experience more.</span></p><p style=""><br/></p><p style=""><strong><span class="fe_q_name" style="color: rgb(0,0,0);">What is the total amount requested?</span></strong><br/><strong><span class="lbl_help"><em>Guidance: Indicate the amount you are requesting for the project/event you're proposing.
