I noticed at the FSAE-A 2010 comp that Sophia Uni had a very large ID tube (about 8mm) as their sight tube.</span><br/><br/><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);">We went with a very simple cylindrical tank, holding 1.5L of oil. We followed the Carroll Smith recommendations: lower solid conical baffle, and high perforated baffle, just below inlet from scavenge pump. We run a Dailey Engineering 2-stage pump, but with no oil-air separator (no space). The inlet is curved and enters at a tangent to the cylinder wall.</span><br/><br/><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);">We have 2 holes at the top, for venting and filling. The oil looks fine, and our engine still works after 1 month pre-comp testing (13 actual track days), all events at comp, and several track days post-comp, including 2 hill climbs so far.</span><br/><br/><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);">My advice for separating air from the oil would be to get a mechanical oil-air seperator from Dailey Engineering or similar, as they claim pure oil from the outlet above 3000RPM pump speed.</span><br/><br/><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);">Pitfalls: the 2009 tank had issues with oil being forced out the vent hose, so we made the ID of the vent/breather very large (-10 hose). Remember that air AND oil comes out of the scavenge pump, and that air needs to vent to atmo, and will thus push out any oil in the breater line that can't fall back into the tank. The 09 breather had a small, upward facing hole, but as oil splashed into it, could NOT return into the tank, so was forced out into the catchcans. Our solution (not the best or correct) was to use a large hose stragight into the tank, where any oil splash can fall directly back down. Moral of the story: think very hard about where stuff goes.</span><br/><br/><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);">Last small thing: don't use tiny nuts to secure the oil tank to your chassis, as 6mm and 7mm spanners are less common than 8mm spanners</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);">&quot;</span></p>
