                    <p>These are the objectives with creating a fresh M1 Build project. The big picture idea with this project is to make it easier to navigate the M1 Tune interface and deepen our understanding with what is actually happening with our Build and Tune.</p><p><br/></p><ol><li>Remove everything that is unnecessary in Build.<ol><li>This clutters up the tune and makes it more difficult to find the parameter you want to change or the channel you want to read.Â </li><li>Stuff like Air Conditioning, Boost, Alternative Fuel, etc. isn't used by us but still shows up in the Tune. These things need to be removed in Build completely.</li></ol></li><li>Remove Enumerations that may include things that were pulled out of the build.<ol><li>This is just to make it clear that options that existed for some parameters no longer exist</li></ol></li><li>Add control for everything that is not a part of the base GPRP (type of ECU we have) template.<ol><li>This includes things like DRS, Dyno Control (for the dyno spec of the project), etc.</li><li>This also includes adding sensors that are wired to the ECU to build.</li></ol></li><li>Configure communication between nodes on the CAN bus.<ol><li>In order for the ECU to read sensors that are wired to the PDM or Dash, communication must be configured. This means opening messages, setting CAN message IDs, receiving messages, etc..</li><li>CAN message IDs must be tracked so no two messages have the same ID. This is across all devices connected to the CAN bus.</li></ol></li><li>Edit build items that may be more useful for our Tune.<ol><li>By this, I mean things like changing the max amount of labels an axis can have in a table.</li><li>Need to work with Carson on this to figure out what would make his life easier when tuning the engine.</li></ol></li></ol>
