                    <p><strong>Note: We have a statics page and I'd start there tbh but </strong></p><p><br/></p><p><strong><u>Overview</u></strong></p><p><em><strong>What's the point?</strong></em></p><p>Well (contrary to popular belief) we need aero on the car. To put aero on the car we need to make the aero pieces themselves but also mount them to the car...duh</p><p><br/></p><p><em><strong>What's the goal?</strong></em></p><p>Ideally, we want a light, stiff, and aerodynamic structural system for our aero package.</p><p>It's pretty hard to do this but if we make the package super heavy, we just negate the benefit of having aero on the car.</p><p>If the aero bits are flailing about, we are changing the aerodynamics of the car and can introduce stall and a bunch of other weird transient problems. At the end of the day, we analyze our aero package in CFD as a rigid structure and to correlate our design to the real world the best, it's a good idea to make the package a rigid as we reasonably can. We can get into some relatively predicable aeroelasticity phenomena but that is a pretty time intensive project that wouldn't give much benefit (I'm open to the concept but just seems overkill).</p><p>Lastly, it's not a good idea to put a wind sail of a swan neck on the rear wing. Also, not a smart idea to put a beefy tie rod mounted directly in front of the side wing. Structures will almost always negatively impact the flow field on the car. When we shift from surface design to structure design, we must try to reduce the impact of the structural design as much as possible.</p><p><br/></p><p><strong><u>First Principals</u></strong></p><p><em><strong>Intro</strong></em></p><p>I get it. Structures ain't groundbreaking but eh it eez what it eez.</p><p>We want our aero components to be in static equilibrium. This means we want the net force and net moments on our system to be zero. That's pretty much it. If you make something where this isn't the case, then the package is going to move and it's going to be weird.Â </p><p><br/></p><p><strong><em>FBDs</em></strong></p><p>Ah free body diagrams. This is literally just drawing it out. Do it. It's not hard and it's necessary to get a good picture of your system. Make one for each load case.</p><p><br/></p><p><em><strong>Load Cases and Cycles</strong></em></p><p>A load case is basically a situation the engineer comes up with that applies to your system. We typically design for max load cases and apply a safety factor since we want our system to withstand what we think will be the worst possible situation and also give us some wiggle room in case we pull a big woopsie.</p><p>Cycles define a period where our system enters and exits a load case. So, how many times will you corner, how many times will you accelerate, how many time will you brake, etc. We want our structure to last the whole season so we need to make sure we can survive all testing sessions and competitions.</p><p><br/></p><p><strong><em>Support Types</em></strong></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p>
