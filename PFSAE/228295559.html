                    <p><strong>Background:</strong> For PF23, the team has decided to transition back to using the Yamaha R6. This is a big change from the 450, but it is something the team has done many times in the past, and nothing we can't do again. Because of this, the cooling system needs to be redesigned from the system that is in place on PF22. The cooling system should be able to meet the main goal of keeping the engine coolant temperature below the maximum allowed. We also want to achieve the car-wide goal of keeping everything as lightweight as possible. We are still a ways away from selecting physical components (although we should start thinking about this ASAP because from what I have seen, some of the components are out of stock), but we should use this time to work with the Aero sub-team to figure out the best location to mount the radiators and how much mass flow of air they predict we can get. After we get a mass flow number, we should use the cooling sim (<u><a href="2022-Cooling-Sim_225413407.html">old</a></u> or new??) to find the cooling fin area we need to cool the engine. We should look into bench testing a radiator to find the overall heat transfer coefficient (Dom suggested this in his powertrain education page for cooling). Also for the cooling sim, we should look at data from PF20 to find average horsepower.</p><p><br/></p><p>Designing the cooling system comes down to finding the sweet spot of making it large enough to keep the car cool, while not being too large that it is excessively heavy. We need to look into what safety factor we want to design to (I have heard rumors of a Texas comp so we definitely need to take this into consideration).</p><p><strong>MAIN GOAL OF THE COOLING SYSTEM: </strong>Keep the car's coolant temperature below a safe level (&lt;100C) for the entirety of the events</p><p><strong>Ways to Reach This Goal:</strong></p><ul><li>Proper radiator sizing</li><li>Proper radiator placement</li></ul><p style="margin-left: 40.0px;"><strong>Radiator Sizing:</strong></p><p style="margin-left: 80.0px;">We want the radiators to be as small as possible while still having enough cooling capacity to meet our coolant temperature goal. With the R6, one of the car-wide goals needs to be reduce weight to make up for the engine's weight. </p><p style="margin-left: 40.0px;"><strong>Radiator Placement:</strong></p><p style="margin-left: 80.0px;">We need to place the radiators in a location where they receive enough mass flow of air through them to cool the water effectively, while not creating too much drag or making packaging/maintenance on the car difficult. The goal is to not rely on fans to achieve the mass flow we need to cool the engine. </p><p><strong>Cooling sub-sub-team sub-goals:</strong></p><ul><li>Lightweight<ul><li>Because the R6 weighs more than the 450, each sub-team this year needs to employ a mass-down-mentality to keep PF23 as light as possible. This includes the cooling team. We need to make sure we can cool the car effectively while being as light as possible.</li></ul></li><li>Well packaged<ul><li>The R6 is not only heavier, it is physically larger too making packaging more difficult than the 450. We want everything to be well thought out and neatly placed on the car. Even if a poorly packaged system works, a well packaged system looks better and shows the judges we took the time to think everything out instead of just slapping some radiators and hoses on the car.</li></ul></li><li>Easy to work on<ul><li>This relates to packaging. If something breaks on the car, we don't want to have to completely disassemble the entire car to work on it. Likely, we are going to be in the way of something at some point, but we should be mindful and avoid doing something dumb like designing a cooling system that needs to be removed if we want to change oil or refuel. </li></ul></li></ul><p><br/></p><hr/><p><strong>Cooling System Components:</strong></p><ul><li>Engine:</li></ul><p style="margin-left: 80.0px;">With the R6 we will be making more power than the 450, which means we will have more heat to reject from the engine to the surroundings. The location of the coolant exit on the engine is also in a different spot than on the 450. Because of this, packaging and hose routing will be different than PF22 (we still have PF20 look at at take notes of pros/cons as well). We should look at the average power the engine produces during an endurance so we can find how much heat will be going into the coolant so that the radiators can be properly sized to remove that heat effectively.</p><ul><li>Radiators:</li></ul><p style="margin-left: 80.0px;">The radiators are the main way that heat is rejected from the cooling system. There a few different types of radiators but they all work in the same basic way. Hot water enters the radiator tank and flows through the radiator through tubes into the opposite tank. As the water moves through the tubes, the heat is pulled from the water into the tubes. These tubes are covered in fins that absorb the heat from the tubes. Air flowing through the radiator pulls the heat from the fins and into the surroundings. The different types of radiators include single-pass, dual-pass, cross-flow, and down-flow. As the name implies, coolant in a single-pass radiator passes through the radiator one time, the inlet and outlet are normally on different sides for a single-pass radiators. For dual-pass radiators, the water passes through the radiator twice, and the inlet and outlet are usually on the same side. Dual-pass radiators typically require a larger, stronger water pump to create the pressure required to pass the water through the radiator twice. The difference between cross-flow and down-flow is the direction the coolant flows. In cross-flow, the tanks are on the sides of the radiators and the water flows horizontally. On a down flow radiator, the tanks are on the top and bottom and the coolant flows downward. Another option with radiators is choosing how the coolant flows through multiple radiators. There are two main ways to do this, series and parallel. For radiators in series, the coolant goes through one radiator, then the other. For radiators in parallel, the coolant is split and flows through both radiators simultaneously and an even rate (hopefully...). Theoretically, having radiators in parallel would be better for cooling than having radiators in series because the water at the inlet of the two radiators is higher which helps heat transfer <span style="color: rgb(0,51,102);">(Q=mCΔT). With radiators in series, the coolant temperature at the inlet of the second radiator is lower because it has already gone through the first radiator, which is worse for heat transfer.</span> Again, radiators in parallel are better theoretically, but a paper from Cal Poly FSAE (below) suggests radiators in series because it can be difficult to ensure that both radiators in parallel are receiving the same amount of coolant, in which case the cooling performance would be reduced (just what one paper said but maybe something to think about why PF22 wasn't being cooled as effectively as we thought). (PF20 has two single-pass, down-flow radiators in series. On PF22, we had two single-pass, down-flow radiators in parallel).</p><ul><li>Catch Can:</li></ul><p style="margin-left: 80.0px;">The catch can is a vessel that works as an overflow reservoir for the cooling system. We fill the cooling system 100% full so that there are no air pockets in the system while the engine is running (air pockets are bad for the water pump and bad for engine cooling). However, as the car is running, the water heats up and expands. Where does the coolant go since we already have the system 100% full? That is where the catch can comes into play. There is a pressure cap on the swirlpot with a spring in it. When the pressure in the system exceeds a certain level, the pressure causes the spring in the cap to compress and allows excess water to leave through a tube and be collected in the catch can. The water is then stored in the catch can until the system cools down, decreases in volume, and creates a vacuum in the system, at which point a straw that reaches to the bottom of the catch can pulls the water back into the system so it remains 100% full. Rules specify that the catch can volume needs to be 10% of the cooling system volume, or .9L, whichever is larger. For PF22 we used an aluminum beer can. This proved to be a good solution as they are light, strong enough, and meet the rules requirements for volume. PF22's catch cans were wrapped in carbon fiber. This was crucial to the catch cans durability (before we did this, we had issues with the catch cans being rubbed through by the mounting tabs or crushed by the zip ties and hose clamps. The catch cans became somewhat of a &quot;wear item&quot;. After we wrapped the cans in carbon, we no longer had issues with the cans deteriorating, and we used those cans for the rest of the season. Also, hose clamps should be used over zip-ties to meet rules, but they are also much more sturdy and confidence inspiring). Rules for catch cans can be found at (T.5.6).</p><ul><li>Swirl Pot:</li></ul><p style="margin-left: 80.0px;">The goal of the swirl pot is to remove air pockets in the system. It is a small reservoir placed close to the water exit of the engine. It is normally the highest point of the cooling system, which helps to get rid of the air bubbles. It works by water entering the top of the swirlpot and exiting through the bottom. The air is simply not taken in through the exit if there is enough coolant in the system. The intake tube at the top is offset from the center, generating a &quot;swirl&quot; in the coolant and giving the swirlpot its name. The swirlpot also serves as a convenient location to fill and bleed our cooling system. It is also the location of the pressure cap that leaks coolant into the catch can. In Tune to Win, Carroll Smith says the top of the swirl pot should be bled back into the catch can. We do this, but with the pressure cap, so I'm not sure if the effect is the same.</p><ul><li>Water Pump:</li></ul><p style="margin-left: 80.0px;">The R6 makes more power than the 450 which means it produces more heat (which makes sense if you think about the 1/3 rule). On PF22 with the 450, we just relied on the stock mechanical water pump. For PF20, the team used an <a class="external-link" href="https://www.pegasusautoracing.com/productdetails.asp?RecId=25768&amp;utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=DC8005&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjw5ZSWBhCVARIsALERCvzqWHULz1GZmi807IRBCxiSgnk-qsdP-FSyZQrQQHc_2RdX82bnlzEaAo6iEALw_wcB" rel="nofollow"><u>electric water pump</u></a> to move the coolant through the system since the stock mechanical pump was removed to make room for the dry sum oil system on the accessory belt. This pump weighs 2lbs, draws 7.5A, and pumps 80Lpm (~21Gpm). From what I have seen larger pumps are better for cooling, so it comes down to finding a pump that is high-flowing, lightweight, compact, affordable, and wont exceed our power availability. </p><ul><li>Coolant:</li></ul><p style="margin-left: 80.0px;">Rules specify that the coolant must be &quot;plain water with no additives of any kind&quot; (T.5.4.1). However for PF22, we ran into a situation with our testing schedule where we were running the car in below freezing temperatures. To keep the cooling system from freezing while the engine was not running, we added antifreeze to the system. If that happens again with PF23, we should be sure to flush the cooling system before comp to make sure we are rules compliant. Comp happens in the summer in Michigan so we shouldn't have to worry about freezing the system.</p><ul><li>Silicone Hoses:</li></ul><p style="margin-left: 80.0px;">We use silicone hoses because they have good heat resistance, and are relatively easy to work with. They have good flexibility to allow for movements in the system to prevent cracking. </p><ul><li>Aluminum Tubing:</li></ul><p style="margin-left: 80.0px;">We use aluminum tubing because it is light, strong, and relatively corrosion resistant. It is mostly used for straight sections of the cooling system but they also make bends if we want to look into that. We should look into wall thickness. Dom recommended 0.035in from McMaster but the stuff on HPS (place with silicone hoses) is 0.065in. </p><hr/><p><strong>Things to Consider:</strong></p><ul><li>Making a new cooling sim in MATLAB</li><li>Radiator mounting<ul><li>Does it matter if the radiators are mounted at an angle?</li></ul></li><li>Fans<ul><li>Do not want to rely on fans to cool the car</li></ul></li><li>Safety factor<ul><li>How much should we oversize the cooling system from what the sim tells us?</li></ul></li><li>Water pump sizing<ul><li>There is a slightly lighter one than the one that is on PF20, but it has significantly less flow.</li><li>Which is more important: .6lbs or 40lpm difference?</li></ul></li></ul><hr/><p><strong>Design Inspiration:</strong></p><ul><li><u><a href="WR450F-Cooling-Design-Notebook_164135097.html">PF22</a></u><ul><li>This page is not accurate.
