                    <p>Zach and I met to come to a conclusion regarding the dash in the wheel. We decided that the lack of performance benefit we would receive from making the change was not worth the cost and risk of doing so. We then looked at doing ETC instead. We were confused as to the pure benefit of running ETC so we did some research and talked to Carson about it. We found that, upon immediate inspection, it too was not worth the cost and risk of its implementation. For now, we have decided to keep the M130 and C125 and look into manufacturing our own CAN expander for better I/O capability. I believe that we should still work to develop ETC because if we can remove the majority of its risk the cost of implementation is not that significant. It is then a &quot;why not&quot; situation. When it comes to the wheel, the plan is still to move the majority of vehicle controls to it (<a class="confluence-userlink user-mention" data-username="hparadis" href="https://wiki.itap.purdue.edu/display/~hparadis" data-linked-resource-id="230661284" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="userinfo" data-base-url="https://wiki.itap.purdue.edu">Paradise, Hunter</a> get larger quick release) and possibly do electronic brake bias. We must use a marked rotary as we will not be able to display brake bias information without a custom dash.Â </p>
