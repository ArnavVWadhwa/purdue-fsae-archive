                    <p>The purpose of this project was to find reliable and sufficiently accurate models for structural carbon fiber, outline the design process for a monocoque, and explain the manufacturing and testing of the necessary test panels for SES. This section will also give background on the theory required to understand and interpret the models and SES, namely a survey of mechanics of materials and classical lamination. Design decisions for materials and layup schedule along with test results are discussed. Recommendations for future tests and contact information for important groups and people are given.</p><p><br/></p><h2 id="Monocoque/StructuralCarbon2020-Results">Results</h2><ol><li>Theoretically passed SES with front bulkhead layup of [0 45 0 45] and side impact structure layup of [0 45 0 45 0 0UD 0UD 45 0 45 0 45] and outlined process so it can be repeated with materials available to us.</li><li>The theoretical weight of the monocoque (not including the main roll hoop) is estimated to be 10.97 kg with the layup schedules shown above.</li><li>Determine that BIDC 3D printed inserts could be very good solution if material tests of reinforced onyx can prove sufficient strength. If not, aluminum will work.</li><li>ANSYS model for 3-point-bending and perimeter shear tests were made within 12% average error of test results.</li><li>Process for making and testing SES panels determined with important contacts outside of FSAE included.</li></ol>
