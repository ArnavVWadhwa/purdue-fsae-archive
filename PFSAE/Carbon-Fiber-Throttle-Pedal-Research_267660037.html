After the part has cured these can be used to push apart the molds as you have leverage into the mold through the pin<ul><li>Put tape over holes during layup to seal the hole </li><li>Make hole a clearance hole for the bolts you are using</li><li>Hammer out afterwards using the bolt as a punch</li></ul></li><li>Need right amount of carbon fiber<ul><li>Too much carbon fiber → Can't close the molds properly</li><li>Not enough carbon fiber → Part doesn't fully consolidate into all the necessary features</li><li>You want 60% fiber, 40% resin. Load the mold with the appropriate amount of fiber based on a weight calculation using the density of carbon fiber and the volume of the part</li></ul></li><li>If extra strength is needed somewhere, long strands of fiber can be custom placed as wanted<ul><li>For the throttle pedal we placed them at the top and the bottom along the length of the pedal</li></ul></li><li>For bolted connections, use a metal insert. Threading carbon fiber is not recommended<ul><li>Do not leave holes in the mold. drill them afterwards</li></ul></li><li>If optimized with long fibers, forged carbon fiber can far outperform aluminum in strength, though it is brittle and does not handle large deformations well.</li><li>Forged carbon fiber works much better in bending than tension, which is ideal for a pedal.</li><li>Carbon fiber doesn't generally tolerate very high temperatures. This doesn't matter much for the throttle pedal but should be kept in mind.</li></ul><h1 id="CarbonFiberThrottlePedalResearch-Moldingsteps">Molding steps </h1><ol><li>Apply release agent (wax) to molds<ol><li>Get some in the bolt holes and parting surface too</li></ol></li><li>Cover release holes in tape</li><li>Weigh out your fiber and put it in a separate container<ol><li>We used the paper cups by the layup tables</li></ol></li><li>Mix the epoxy. You want an excess, so make enough that the resin weighs 25% more than the fiber you are using for the part<ol><li>The epoxy we used was 3 parts resin, 1 part hardener</li></ol></li><li>Put a thin coat of epoxy all over the mold surfaces</li><li>Load the fiber a little at a time, pushing it down with a brush wet with resin little by little to make sure the fiber in the mold is fully soaked.<ol><li>Try to load the fiber evenly, it will seem that there is too much fiber. This is good because the mix will need to be compressed to make the part. This is why it is good to have a long extension on the mold, as the mixture will take up more space in this stage than what the completed part will.</li><li>Blunt tools can be useful for pressing in the fiber. It should feel firm and compacted once you're done</li></ol></li><li>Close the mold halves together with a vice or press<ol><li>Resin will drip out of the mold so place something like newspaper under the vice to catch that</li><li>Clamp the mold progressively over 5 to 10 minutes. If you clamp the mold too quickly the excess resin won't have time to drip out and the mold may experience hydraulic lock and crack under the high pressures formed.</li><li>Once the molds are bottomed out, the fiber to resin ratio will be calculated optimum amount</li></ol></li><li>Leave the molds clamped for 24 hours at room temperature</li><li>Unclamp the molds and hammer wedges into the chamfers left into the molds<ol><li>Work slowly from all sides to make sure the molds stay parallel during separation</li><li>The component will usually remain in the female half of the mold. To get it out, lightly tap the dowell pins left in the mold with a hammer to push out the part</li></ol></li><li>Clean off flash lines with a knife and/or sandpaper<ol><li>Use dremel tool to cut off the carbon that got into the chamfer</li></ol></li><li>Wipe off release agent residue with a cloth and mold cleaner</li><li>Do any post process machining like drilling holes</li><li>Fill in surface voids by placing epoxy and fibers in the hole and letting it cure</li><li>To make the part look cool and carbon fiberey, clear coat it.<ol><li>Sandpaper the part, and then spray several coats of clear coat paint, and polishing it once dry</li><li>Can also coat the whole thing in a thin coat of epoxy and let it cure</li></ol></li></ol><h1 id="CarbonFiberThrottlePedalResearch-LessonsLearned">Lessons Learned </h1><ol><li>CAM is very challenging, 3d printed mold comparison pending<ol><li>Getting tight geometry is tough in the bottom mold because the geometry is pretty deep down due to the chamfer</li><li>Make the chamfer with a chamfer mill. </li><li>Surface doesn't have to be too amazing, scalloped surfaces often ok - It'll sand out<ol><li>The wax fills in the scallops a little bit</li></ol></li></ol></li><li>Bolts are great for tightening<ol><li>Place them evenly around the mold. Place some in the middle so it doesn't bow out</li></ol></li><li>Use bolts as punches to get the part out of the mold after the layup.
