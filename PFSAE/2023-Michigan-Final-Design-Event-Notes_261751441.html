(Honestly don't really understand what he is getting at here)</li><li>If you were asked to design the chassis again from the start, how would you design it? (I think he was implying designing the chassis without access to past documentation or testing data?)</li><li>What is the impact of moving sus points to (eliminate bend in front hoop and) remove tubes?</li><li>How did you constrain the chassis for torsion test?<ul><li>How did you decide the numbers for loading increments used in torsion test? (basically the applied load info <a href="PF23-Torsion-Test-0000_250317515.html">here</a>)</li></ul></li></ul><p><strong>`Judge 2:</strong></p><ul><li>Let's say the tires on your car are infinitely grippy and the car can corner infinitely fast. As the cornering velocity of the car increases, which tube(s) will fail first? At approximately what G? <ul><li>If we bump that up to 1G further then which tubes will fail next? Approx how many will fail?</li></ul></li></ul><p>→ Christian: Well, as you can see with our FEA results here, the lower engine mount will fail first.</p><ul><li>Why is that? </li><li>What is the failure mode? <ul><li>If it is a tab, what is the safety factor on that? </li><li>What is margin of safety? Why do you use that?</li><li>What is the 1.2 factor of safety for? </li></ul></li></ul><p><strong>Judge 3 (Bill Riley):</strong></p><ul><li>When you size your tabs, what was the force assumed from the CA?</li><li>If we pull on that front aft upper control arm, what fails first in tension?<ul><li>What are all the possible failure modes for a load on the Front Aft UCA?</li></ul></li><li>If we push on that control arm, what fails first?</li><li>If we pull on that control arm, what fails first?</li></ul><p><strong>Judge 4 (Chris Warren):</strong></p><ul><li>How many degrees of freedom does a chassis have?</li><li>How many degrees of freedom do you want to constrain?<ul><li>Do you want to constrain more DOFs? Why or why not?</li></ul></li><li>Use 6 translational constraints in 4 uprights to ensure all 6 DOFs are constrained (don't worry abt actual torsion test constraints for now) → draw this out on a piece of paper</li></ul><p><strong>Judge 5:</strong></p><ul><li>Why 4130 steel? Why ER-70s filler rod? Why aluminum AIP? Why standard honeycomb IA?</li><li>Why spaceframe over monocoque?<ul><li>How much lighter is a monocoque?</li><li>How much more stiff is a monocoque?</li><li>What factors have you guys considered before opting for a spaceframe vs monocoque chassis?</li></ul></li></ul><h2 id="id-2023MichiganFinalDesignEventNotes-Cockpit|Controls|Brakes|Safety">Cockpit | Controls | Brakes | Safety</h2><h3 id="id-2023MichiganFinalDesignEventNotes-Brakes">Brakes</h3><ul><li>How did you size your master cylinders?
