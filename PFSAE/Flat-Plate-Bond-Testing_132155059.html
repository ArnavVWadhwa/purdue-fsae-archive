                    <p>This document will (for now) record the plans for testing the bond weight of flat plates onto core. I (tyler davis green) am hopefully going to be testing this over the 2020 season to determine the minimum amount of DP460NS needed to bond carbon flat plates onto nomex 3.0 pcf aramid honeycomb core. The test plan should be as follows:</p><p><br/></p><ol><li>Prepare honeycomb and carbon of approx 0.1m^2 area squares.</li><li>Mix DP460NS in amounts corresponding to specific weight increments. I would recommend areal weights of specific increments. The weights planned to be tested for 2020 are 200,150,100, and 50gsm of DP460NS.</li><li>Test the panels on the civil engineering instron (the one we use for IA testing) and determine the minimum amount of epoxy needed for the panels to not delaminate. This might not be the ideal test plan, but is the best we have for now. The panels should all have the same carbon areal weight to reduce the variables influencing the results of the test.</li></ol><p><br/></p><p>I would expect the required weight to be somewhere around 200gsm. This is largely due to the fact that most prepreg requires film adhesive weights of around 150gsm. With an ideal adhesive this is likely all that is needed, so with hand laminated epoxy that is not ideal for the job, 200gsm is probably the minimum needed to prevent delamination of test panels. If any aspiring aero structures composites members are looking to make their mark on the flat plate landscape of the FSAE world, you can probably calculate the shear stress at the bond on a flat plate and determine the ideal weight. Until then we will spend our time on other areas and keep this to around 200gsm.</p>
