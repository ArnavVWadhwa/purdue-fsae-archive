                    <p>The below is my recommendation / thoughts on various vehicle dynamics related parameters as of the 2019 season. Start here to make sure you don't go backwards, but take everything with several grains of salt (the whole shaker).  </p><p><br/></p><h1 id="KinematicsandVehicleDynamicsBasicsForFSAE-TheBigDimensions">The Big Dimensions</h1><h2 id="KinematicsandVehicleDynamicsBasicsForFSAE-Wheelbase">Wheelbase</h2><div>Lap sim indicates that there is increase in lateral acceleration as wheelbase increases. However, geometry indicates that the course gets larger because of the wheelbase. When this is taken into account, as well as weight from the extra length of each tube at a cross section of the chassis, it barely matters.</div><h2 style="font-family: sans-serif;" id="KinematicsandVehicleDynamicsBasicsForFSAE-Track">Track</h2><div>Can prove with lap time simulation that smallest is best. This is done by adjusting the track (course) to be smaller or larger based on track width. IE a 90 degree corner is still a 90 degree corner, but it is now a larger radius by 1/2 the increase in track width. How small you can go is then constrained by the tilt test or predicted rollover whichever comes first. Applying a 1.1 safety factor to tilt test seems reasonable.</div><div><h2 style="font-family: sans-serif;margin-top: 1.0em;" id="KinematicsandVehicleDynamicsBasicsForFSAE-CGHeight">CG Height</h2></div><div>Pretty straightforward with the lap time simulation. Lower CG improves skidpad, autocross, and endurance, but worsens acceleration. Non acceleration events outweigh acceleration. So this is a sensitivity that can be traded against weight, downforce, etc.</div><div><h2 style="font-family: sans-serif;margin-top: 1.0em;" id="KinematicsandVehicleDynamicsBasicsForFSAE-CGLongitudinalPosition">CG Longitudinal Position</h2></div><div>Another fairly straightforward lap sim application, but the answer is not intuitive. The lap sim indicates that the ideal balance or maximum points is ~44% front distribution. However, the change in points from there to a 52% front distribution is less than two. What does change significantly is where the points come from. With a further forward-shifted cg position, more points come from autocross, skidpad, and endurance vs acceleration. FIXME</div><h1 id="KinematicsandVehicleDynamicsBasicsForFSAE-Tires">Tires</h1><p>A complete discussion of tires can be found in the first chapter of Race Car Vehicle Dynamics (RCVD). That section of RCVD is fairly accessible, so just start right in with that. No need to read <em>Tune to Win </em>first, which is what i'll recommend for most other topics. While reading that is recommended, the information presented below serves to highlight the parameters that I think are most important for our purposes and that I think are sufficient when discussing tire selection in the design event. I also directly compare our available compounds rather than discussing tires in general.</p><p>This is diagram contains the variable names of forces and angles as I will be using them. This comes from Race Car Vehicle Dynamics.</p><p><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper confluence-embedded-manual-size"><img class="confluence-embedded-image" draggable="false" height="400" src="attachments/130157329/135103665.png" data-image-src="attachments/130157329/135103665.png" data-unresolved-comment-count="0" data-linked-resource-id="135103665" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="attachment" data-linked-resource-default-alias="image2019-11-30_18-33-31.png" data-base-url="https://wiki.itap.purdue.edu" data-linked-resource-content-type="image/png" data-linked-resource-container-id="130157329" data-linked-resource-container-version="19" alt=""></span></p><div><h2 style="font-family: sans-serif;margin-top: 1.0em;" id="KinematicsandVehicleDynamicsBasicsForFSAE-Size">Size</h2></div><div>Smaller is better until you make packaging impossible. For now we're on the 10&quot; rim with 18&quot; OD, but going to the smaller OD available on the same rim would be worth while at some point. Just a matter of dealing with redesigning a bunch of the suspension and the chassis for a fairly small number of points, so it's not on the priority list for now.</div><div><h2 style="font-family: sans-serif;margin-top: 1.0em;" id="KinematicsandVehicleDynamicsBasicsForFSAE-Compound">Compound</h2></div><div>For now, this means Hoosier LC0 vs R25b. These tires are sufficiently different to make for a good general discussion of tire parameters.</div><div>The most important parameters in tire selection are below:</div><h3 id="KinematicsandVehicleDynamicsBasicsForFSAE-Lateralforce(Fy)vsslipangle(SAorα):">Lateral force (Fy) vs slip angle (SA or α):</h3><p><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper"><img class="confluence-embedded-image" draggable="false" src="attachments/130157329/134185338.png" data-image-src="attachments/130157329/134185338.png" data-unresolved-comment-count="0" data-linked-resource-id="134185338" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="attachment" data-linked-resource-default-alias="image2019-11-19_16-2-13.png" data-base-url="https://wiki.itap.purdue.edu" data-linked-resource-content-type="image/png" data-linked-resource-container-id="130157329" data-linked-resource-container-version="19" alt=""></span><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper confluence-embedded-manual-size"><img class="confluence-embedded-image confluence-external-resource" draggable="false" alt="Image result for slip angle lateral force" height="400" src="https://d3i71xaburhd42.cloudfront.net/3f9ebcc3f9b74194721a299ab2b2ebbc9652453d/2-Figure1-1.png" data-image-src="https://d3i71xaburhd42.cloudfront.net/3f9ebcc3f9b74194721a299ab2b2ebbc9652453d/2-Figure1-1.png"></span></p><p>This is the most defining graph for a tire (from a performance stand point). Each curve on the graph will be at a given normal force and inclination angle (camber * -1). There are three main regions to look at, the linear region (low slip angles), transitional region (building up to peak), and the sliding region (after peak). The slope of the linear region is called the <strong>cornering stiffness (ΔFy / Δα)</strong>. The cornering stiffness and shape of the function up to the peak lateral force will determine the transient response on turn in as well as how much steering input is required to maintain lateral accelerations below maximum. This can be seen from the graphs on the right. The R25b provides a higher peak yaw acceleration (how quickly the car turns in) than the LC0 due to the higher cornering stiffness.</p><p>It's worth noting that needing a higher slip angle to achieve maximum lateral force <em>will </em>hurt the maximum lateral acceleration capability of the vehicle. This is because an increased steering angle will be required. This will cause more of the lateral force to become longitudinal force pushing against the motion of the car. This is doubly bad. Firstly, you lose some lateral force from what you see on the graph because the lateral force on the car from the tire will be multiplied by cosine of the steering angle. Secondly, you will have more drag force pulling back on the car in the longitudinal direction. This force will be the lateral force seen on the graph time sine of the steering angle. </p><p>The absolute maximum value of lateral acceleration is generally worth being skeptical of. This is because these tests are performed on ideal, sand-paper like road surface. So all you know is that one tire provides higher maximum lateral acceleration on a surface that may not directly translate into the surface we actually drive on.</p><p>The curve in the transitional region is very important, but harder to quantify. You can see that the R25b reaches a peak and falls off while the LC0 has a large plateau. In an ideal world, you would hit the peak and call it a day, but that's not what happens. Accordingly, this region will change how the car feels to the driver when at and over the limit. Testing performed and documented here (<a href="129009853.html">9/14/2019 Grissom - Hoosier R25b vs. LCO Track Testing</a>) speaks to this difference. While both tires achieved similar times in skidpad and autocross events, the driver feeling was entirely different. With the large drop off of the R25b curve, it is very clear when the limit is hit. There were multiple snap oversteer moments. With the LC0's plateau, drivers achieved the same times with relatively drama free laps. Drivers also felt like there may have been more performance available. However this larger peak comes with more steering force, which we'll discuss with the next important tire graph.</p><h3 id="KinematicsandVehicleDynamicsBasicsForFSAE-AligningMoment(Mz)vsslipangle(SAorα):">Aligning Moment (Mz) vs slip angle (SA or α):</h3><p><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper confluence-embedded-manual-size"><img class="confluence-embedded-image" draggable="false" height="400" src="attachments/130157329/135103741.png" data-image-src="attachments/130157329/135103741.png" data-unresolved-comment-count="0" data-linked-resource-id="135103741" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="attachment" data-linked-resource-default-alias="image2019-12-1_16-28-59.png" data-base-url="https://wiki.itap.purdue.edu" data-linked-resource-content-type="image/png" data-linked-resource-container-id="130157329" data-linked-resource-container-version="19" alt=""></span></p><p>This graph indicates the torque on the wheel that would be attempting to realign the wheels to be in the direction of motion.  Each curve will be at a given normal force and inclination angle for a specific tire. The mechanism for this is contact patch migration. A torque on the wheel is created because force is applied to an offset contact patch. This is indicated in the figure (from RCVD as always) below.</p><p><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper confluence-embedded-manual-size"><img class="confluence-embedded-image" draggable="false" height="400" src="attachments/130157329/135103747.png" data-image-src="attachments/130157329/135103747.png" data-unresolved-comment-count="0" data-linked-resource-id="135103747" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="attachment" data-linked-resource-default-alias="image2019-12-1_16-42-16.png" data-base-url="https://wiki.itap.purdue.edu" data-linked-resource-content-type="image/png" data-linked-resource-container-id="130157329" data-linked-resource-container-version="19" alt=""></span></p><p><br/></p><p>So the combination of mechanical trail (which will be discussed in the kinematics section) and the pneumatic trail (from tire contact patch migration) creates the total moment arm that creates aligning moment when the tire is creating lateral force. So, the tire contributes an amount of steering force that varies non-linearly with lateral force as opposed to mechanical trail. This does two things. The first is obvious: this accounts for a large portion of the overall steering force required from the driver. So, if all the kinematic and ergonomic dials for reducing steering force have been turned and it remains problematic, tire selection is the next dial. The second role of tire aligning torque is more subtle. It provides &quot;feedback&quot; to the driver as it is a function of slip angle, not purely lateral acceleration. The peak aligning moment occurs at a slip angle significantly lower than that of the peak lateral force. The steering force due to mechanical trail will max out at the peak lateral force, so it will push the net steering force back towards the maximum lateral force. Having steering force peak shortly before lateral force falls off serves to warn the driver about impending loss of grip. It's hard to say exactly what fraction of lateral acceleration you want this to occur at, but it's probably safe to say it'd be somewhere between 70 and 90%.</p><p>This is well-illustrated by a plot of steering torque with the the r25b and LC0 compounds with the same suspension geometry (2018 in this case).</p><p><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper confluence-embedded-manual-size"><img class="confluence-embedded-image" draggable="false" height="250" src="attachments/130157329/135103754.png" data-image-src="attachments/130157329/135103754.png" data-unresolved-comment-count="0" data-linked-resource-id="135103754" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="attachment" data-linked-resource-default-alias="image2019-12-1_17-5-2.png" data-base-url="https://wiki.itap.purdue.edu" data-linked-resource-content-type="image/png" data-linked-resource-container-id="130157329" data-linked-resource-container-version="19" alt=""></span></p><p>With the R25b, steering torque is reduced by 14%. This is probably a good thing. However, the maximum steering input occurs immediately before the maximum lateral force, so essentially no warning would be provided. The LC0, however, provides a plateau in steering torque that starts at around 90% of the maximum lateral force, so some feel will be provided to the driver. In both cases, reducing the mechanical trail will both reduce the total steering force required and shift the peak further forward of the maximum lateral force. These are both positive effects, so small mechanical trails are generally preferred despite some tradeoffs that will be discussed in the Kinematics section. (This effect is sometimes shown by plotting the steering force components from the mechanical and pneumatic trail separately on the same graph.)</p><p><br/></p><h3 id="KinematicsandVehicleDynamicsBasicsForFSAE-Longitudinalforce(Fx)vsslipratio(SR):">Longitudinal force (Fx) vs slip ratio (SR):</h3><p>Slip ratio is a way of quantifying the amount of &quot;spinning&quot; / &quot;skidding&quot; occurring. It is the ratio the tire rotation speed to the tire rotation speed if no slip were occurring. This is what creates acceleration and braking forces. </p><p><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper"><img class="confluence-embedded-image" draggable="false" src="attachments/130157329/135103759.png" data-image-src="attachments/130157329/135103759.png" data-unresolved-comment-count="0" data-linked-resource-id="135103759" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="attachment" data-linked-resource-default-alias="image2019-12-1_17-25-52.png" data-base-url="https://wiki.itap.purdue.edu" data-linked-resource-content-type="image/png" data-linked-resource-container-id="130157329" data-linked-resource-container-version="19" alt=""></span></p><p>The graph can be interpreted essentially the same way as the lateral acceleration vs slip angle graph.</p><h3 id="KinematicsandVehicleDynamicsBasicsForFSAE-Inclinationanglesensitivity">Inclination angle sensitivity</h3><p>Inclination angle is just camber but negative. 2 degrees inclination angle is -2 degrees camber. So this is also often called camber sensitivity.</p><p>Peak lateral acceleration is generally available at a small, positive value of inclination angle. Peak longitudinal acceleration is generally available at an inclination angle of 0. Lateral acceleration is usually more affected by inclination angle than longitudinal acceleration, which is why inclination angle targets are usually biased toward cornering. This is shown by the lateral force vs inclination angle at peak slip angle graphs in the preceding sections.</p><p>Aligning moment vs slip angle is also affected by inclination angle, but this is again a fairly weak effect. </p><p><br/></p><h3 id="KinematicsandVehicleDynamicsBasicsForFSAE-Loadsensitivity">Load sensitivity</h3><p>If you take the maximum lateral acceleration at each normal force and compute a friction coefficient (mu = Fy / Fz), it will become clear that the friction coefficient decreases with normal force. This is commonly called load sensitivity. This effect is the driving mechanism for being able to tune understeer oversteer behavior using spring rates, anti-roll bars, tire pressures, etc. This will be discussed more in the springs and dampers section.</p><p>For the LC0 and R25b, load sensitivity is generally similar. But you can imagine the case where, because of load sensitivity, the correct tire choice may differ for a heavy vs light car.</p><p>For what it's worth, as load increases, the required slip angle to produce maximum lateral force will increase. The ideal camber angle for producing maximum lateral force will also increase. But that's getting into the weeds.</p><p><br/></p><h1 id="KinematicsandVehicleDynamicsBasicsForFSAE-Kinematics">Kinematics</h1><p>I recommend reading the suspension geometry chapter of <em>Tune to Win </em>to become familiar with the parameters discussed here, particularly how to design to them once targets have been set. That part is fairly formulaic, so I plan on only discussing how I have gone about setting the targets in the past.</p><h2 id="KinematicsandVehicleDynamicsBasicsForFSAE-CamberCurves">Camber Curves</h2><div>If there’s one thing that gets too much attention this is probably it. But it still deserves some attention.</div><div>Firstly, the best way to avoid bad camber is to avoid body roll. You're never going to get a camber curve that prevents positive (bad) camber from occurring on the outside tire. But soft (relatively) springs are necessary to keep the wheels on the ground on bumpy surfaces, so some body roll is unavoidable. Designing camber curves mitigates this effect. I'll leave it to the reader to work out how a camber curve is designed in a double-wishbone suspension.</div><div> </div><div>The targets for camber curves should come from tire data. At the loads for a braking, acceleration, and cornering case, there will be an ideal amount of camber. For braking and accelerating, this will be 0. For cornering, it will be approximately -1 to -1.5 degrees. However, the lateral force is a stronger function. So, in general, the goal should be to meet targets for lateral acceleration without needing crazy amounts of static camber. Be sure to look for sharp drop offs in the lateral or longitudinal force vs camber plot. That can give a target for a compromise.</div><div>The front camber curve is less aggressive than the rear because caster can be used to create camber gain with steering. See how much camber can be picked up with steering, then finish with camber gain with heave (camber curve).</div><div>In the rear, strike a compromise directly with a more aggressive camber curve. In general, the best that can be gotten is camber that stays negative in cornering with a small amount of static camber (~-.5).</div><div>On track, camber is adjusted based on tire temperatures. The going claim is that equal temperatures across the contact patch indicates best case tire utilization. So, if the inside of the tire is hotter add positive camber and vice verses. Additionally, if the center is hotter than the outsides, reduce tire pressure and vice verses. This indicates that for the given loading and usage, the pressure and camber are correct.</div><h2 id="KinematicsandVehicleDynamicsBasicsForFSAE-RollCenters">Roll Centers</h2><p>And if there's one thing that's darn near impossible to find good information about, it's roll centers (followed by ackermann). Roll centers should be selected to make the car have neutral oversteer/understeer characteristics in transient events <em>with the dampers in the middle of their usable range</em>. This assures that the dampers can be used to tune from transient understeer to transient oversteer. These figures show how that looks:</p><p><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper"><img class="confluence-embedded-image" draggable="false" src="attachments/130157329/137592922.png" data-image-src="attachments/130157329/137592922.png" data-unresolved-comment-count="0" data-linked-resource-id="137592922" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="attachment" data-linked-resource-default-alias="image2019-12-25_22-52-3.png" data-base-url="https://wiki.itap.purdue.edu" data-linked-resource-content-type="image/png" data-linked-resource-container-id="130157329" data-linked-resource-container-version="19" alt=""></span></p><p><br/></p><p>Transient understeer is when there is no real yaw overshoot, the car just immediately pushes. Transient oversteer is when there is significant yaw overshoot. The car over rotates, four wheel drifts, and then settles out.</p><p>Being able to adjust between these behaviors is desirable, as some behavior in between is certainly ideal.</p><p>The case I used to look for these behaviors is created as follows: I ran a 27ft radius corner with the quasi steady state solver. I then ran a step steer case that was 5 mph above vehicle capability in that corner and had the step steer go to the steering amount that corresponded to that corner. I had the step steer take .5 seconds based on the speed of steering input that I have seen in testing data. This makes for the case where the driver comes into a corner somewhat too fast.</p><p>The challenge of this, then, becomes defining the usable range of the dampers, as that will be necessary to show the ranges behavior achievable by damper adjustment. This KAZ resource (<a class="external-link" href="https://www.kaztechnologies.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/A-Guide-To-Your-Dampers-Chapter-from-FSAE-Book-by-Jim-Kasprzak.pdf" rel="nofollow">https://www.kaztechnologies.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/A-Guide-To-Your-Dampers-Chapter-from-FSAE-Book-by-Jim-Kasprzak.pdf</a>) has recommendations for ranges of damping ratio for both sprung and unsprung mass. Using those and the expected spring rates, damping rate bounds can be selected. This is discussed in the dampers section with calculations.</p><p>So the goal would be to show that using the range of reasonable damping values, transient balance can be tuned. When I've gone through these calculations, I've found that the range of reasonable damping adjustment has minimal effect. I have found that, if going beyond that range into what I thought, at the time at least, was unreasonable, the roll center positions did effect the corresponding range of handling outputs. I have also found that, with a given damping setup, adjusting the roll centers makes a very small difference. </p><p>All the above only really provides a method for setting the relative heights, but not the heights together. So far, I have set the heights somewhere that seemed reasonable based on the fact that if placed too high, it will be difficult to adjust the cars steady state balance via springs. If the roll centers were set such that the neutral axis passed through the CG, adjustment via springs would be impossible because no load during roll would go through the springs. This is why I chose to keep the roll centers relatively low. However, I have done no additional work to determine quantitatively how high is too high. I suspect that the correct way to do this would be to look at the range of frequencies that can be accepted for pitch, roll, and the unsprung mass as well as ride height change. This would give a range of acceptable wheel rates in bump conditions. That would dictate ranges of acceptable spring rates. Roll centers would then need to be set low enough that the given range of spring rates can provide a targeted amount of adjustment to the total lateral load transfer distribution (LLTD). While, I am confident that the current settings do this, proving it quantatively would yield higher design scores and possibly indicate that roll centers could be moved higher. This would be beneficial as it would allow softer springs without increasing roll. This could give a more responsive car with same amount of mechanical grip. A few good teams have gone this route, the University of Wisconsin being the best of them that comes to mind.</p><h2 id="KinematicsandVehicleDynamicsBasicsForFSAE-FrontCaster/Kingpininclination/Offset">Front Caster / Kingpin inclination / Offset</h2><p>This diagram has definitions of these values as well as the two values that come from them: mechanical trail and scrub radius</p><p>(note: offset = side view kingpin offset) </p><h3 id="KinematicsandVehicleDynamicsBasicsForFSAE-"><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper"><img class="confluence-embedded-image confluence-external-resource" draggable="false" alt="Image result for suspension kingpin angle" src="https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-689b0971ae748061565f2a316a9de832" data-image-src="https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-689b0971ae748061565f2a316a9de832"></span></h3><h3 id="KinematicsandVehicleDynamicsBasicsForFSAE-MechanicalTrail">Mechanical Trail</h3><p>FIXME</p><h3 id="KinematicsandVehicleDynamicsBasicsForFSAE-ScrubRadius">Scrub Radius</h3><p>FIXME</p><h2 id="KinematicsandVehicleDynamicsBasicsForFSAE-SteeringRackRatio,SteeringWheelDiameter,andSteeringArmLength">Steering Rack Ratio, Steering Wheel Diameter, and Steering Arm Length</h2><h2 id="KinematicsandVehicleDynamicsBasicsForFSAE-MotionRatio">Motion Ratio</h2><p>The first decision is whether to run a constant or progressive motion ratio. A progressive motion ratio increases the wheel rate as the suspension compresses. This can be helpful for having more mechanical grip at low speeds while reducing maintaining adequate ground clearance at high speeds. However, a negative effect would be in the vehicle balance through a corner. While simultaneously braking and turning on corner entry, the front suspension will be compressed and the rear will be extended. This will have the effect, with progressive spring rates, of shifting Total Transverse Load Transfer forward increasing understeer. On corner exit, the effect will be reversed. The rear will be compressed and front extended, so oversteer will be increased. The tendency of rear-wheel-drive vehicle with neutral mid corner balance is already to push (understeer) during corner entrance and fishtail (oversteer) due to throttle application on corner exit. So, progressive motion ratio will inrease this tendency, which is not desired. While it would be possible to attempt to avoid this with differential settings and damper settings, I am of the opinion that for the limited testing time typical in Formula SAE, the most direct path to driver-friendly vehicle dynamics should be taken. Additionally, constant motion ratio makes wheel load calculations from dampers more straightforward. (This is even better if the motion ratio is just 1). </p><p>In summary then, progressive motion ratio will help mechanical grip while maintaining ride height for a high-downforce vehicle, but will negatively effect transient behavior in corner exit and entry. This makes for a compromise that is hard to justify in a quantifiable way, so take the route that is easier to design and easier to interpret test data with: constant motion ratio.</p><h2 id="KinematicsandVehicleDynamicsBasicsForFSAE-Anti-Roll-BarGeometry">Anti-Roll-Bar Geometry</h2><p>I have found that it is easiest to think about roll bar settings in terms of the equivalent spring adjustment. For the 2020 vehicle, I chose to design ARBs to provide adjustment up to the equivalent of changing two spring sizes. This is reasonably easily done in terms of lever lengths and bar sizes, and seems certain to provide enough adjustment. The initial settings of a vehicle with TLLTD set to match the weight distribution will assure that this amount of adjustability is adequate. However, it would be best to quantify it producing a range of TTLTD that the car can be tuned to.</p><p>For the physical shape of the ARB, using the U-bar design with adjustable lever length is by far the simplest route. It should be used as there is minimal weight penalty compared to any other system and can be designed in a few hours without any FEA required. There are only three real concerns: droplink length, slop, and cantilevered bar. If the drop links are made so short to where adjustment is impossible due to rod end misaligment limits, that is obviously bad. This can necessitate a blade design for adjustment, which I will touch on shortly. The system must have minimal slop so that there is not a large dead zone in the center. Care must be taken with the joints. The other way to prevent compliance effects is to make sure the system moves a lot. Try to mount the drop links to the rocker with the smallest motion ratio (most movement) so that slop is small relative to the motion of the system. Finally, if the mounts for bar are not close to the levers, there will be bending in the system that will act a spring in parallel. If this is not accounted for, the arb will provide less effect than predicted. However, by designing to have the equivalent adjustment of two spring rate changes (50 lbf/in increments), it is likely that this loss in stiffness will be acceptable. But for whatever reason judges always mention this despite the fact that OEM u-bars are much larger offenders. I think we just need to claim that we accounted for it in our stiffness calculations.</p><p><br/></p><p><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper confluence-embedded-manual-size"><img class="confluence-embedded-image confluence-external-resource" draggable="false" height="250" src="https://www.carid.com/images/bmr-suspension/items/xsb006h-5.jpg" data-image-src="https://www.carid.com/images/bmr-suspension/items/xsb006h-5.jpg"></span></p><p><em>massively cantilevered u-bar being used on some OEM vehicle possibly designed by the judge roasting you for your massively cantilevered u-bar</em></p><p><br/></p><p>If the drop links must be made so short that lever length adjustment becomes impossible, than a rotating blade must be used. This works by changing the second moment of area and thus the stiffness via rotation of the blade. Size the blade such that its verticle position matches the most stiffness needed and the horizontal position gives the least stiffness needed. Remember that the system is two blade springs in series with the bar spring. </p><p>The specific increments of adjustment must then be found via sweeps in FEA. between vertical and horizontal. This will be a bit of a pain to setup, which is why the lever length approach is preferred when packaging allows. </p><p><br/></p><p>This image shows the two methods that are most commonly implemented:</p><p><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper confluence-embedded-manual-size"><img class="confluence-embedded-image confluence-external-resource" draggable="false" height="250" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/58/Antiroll_Bar2.svg/220px-Antiroll_Bar2.svg.png" data-image-src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/58/Antiroll_Bar2.svg/220px-Antiroll_Bar2.svg.png"></span></p><p> </p><p><br/></p><h1 id="KinematicsandVehicleDynamicsBasicsForFSAE-SpringDamperStuff">Spring Damper Stuff</h1><h2 id="KinematicsandVehicleDynamicsBasicsForFSAE-WheelandARBandTireRates">Wheel and ARB and Tire Rates</h2><h3 id="KinematicsandVehicleDynamicsBasicsForFSAE-WheelLoads">Wheel Loads</h3><p>The combined effect of wheel rate, tire rate, and ARB rate (in combination with geometry settings) is lateral load transfer distribution (LLTD). When cornering at a given lateral acceleration, the total amount of lateral load transfer is fixed. However, the amount of lateral load transfer that occurs on the front vs the rear can be tuned. In short, if you stiffen the front of the car, more lateral load transfer occurs there. Then your front wheel loads are more unequal than you rear wheel loads. Because of tire load sensitivity, this causes less total grip on the front. Accordingly, under steer has been added. In terms of actually figuring out the progression of calculations involved, RCVD chapter 16 and 18 are pretty easy to work through. You'll go from spring rate, to wheel rate, to roll rate, to lateral load transfer, to lateral load transfer distribution. My only word of caution on content in these chapters is to avoid getting caught up in chassis torsion rates. Via fairly simple FEA, the direct change in wheel loads to chassis compliance can be worked out, so there is no reason to not go straight to that.</p><h3 id="KinematicsandVehicleDynamicsBasicsForFSAE-VehicleFrequencies">Vehicle Frequencies</h3><p>This is the other primary set of parameters set by wheel, ARB, and tire rates. There are four frequencies to take into account:</p><h4 id="KinematicsandVehicleDynamicsBasicsForFSAE-RideFrequency">Ride Frequency</h4><p>FIXME</p><h4 id="KinematicsandVehicleDynamicsBasicsForFSAE-Wheelhopfrequency">Wheel hop frequency</h4><p>FIXME</p><h4 id="KinematicsandVehicleDynamicsBasicsForFSAE-Pitchfrequency">Pitch frequency</h4><p>FIXME</p><h4 id="KinematicsandVehicleDynamicsBasicsForFSAE-Rollfrequency">Roll frequency</h4><p>FIXME</p><h3 id="KinematicsandVehicleDynamicsBasicsForFSAE-ChassisMovement">Chassis Movement</h3><p>Oh fine, there's one more thing</p><h4 id="KinematicsandVehicleDynamicsBasicsForFSAE-RideHeight">Ride Height</h4><p>FIXME</p><h4 id="KinematicsandVehicleDynamicsBasicsForFSAE-PitchRate">Pitch Rate</h4><p>FIXME</p><h4 id="KinematicsandVehicleDynamicsBasicsForFSAE-RollRate">Roll Rate</h4><p>FIXME</p><h2 id="KinematicsandVehicleDynamicsBasicsForFSAE-Dampers">Dampers</h2><p>There are four total damper settings that matter: slow rebound, fast rebound, slow compression, and fast compression. The fast settings determine how the car handles sudden inputs like a sharp bump or high frequency bumps. The slow rebound affects transient vehicle balance during turn in, corner exit, and direction change. This document (<a class="external-link" href="https://www.ohlinsusa.com/files/files/TTX25%20MkII%20Dyno%20lbs%20vs%20ips.pdf" rel="nofollow">https://www.ohlinsusa.com/files/files/TTX25%20MkII%20Dyno%20lbs%20vs%20ips.pdf</a>) has dyno plots for the ohlins TTx25 that we have used since 2016. (We get them in the C12 / R12 valving configuration). The slow speed adjusters change the slope of the first part of the graph. The slope in this graph <em>is the damping rate.</em> The high speed adjusters, however, do not change the slope of the second part of the graph. Instead, they change where that second part intercepts the first part. The slope of the second part is always what it is for a given damper valving. For observing transient tuning in simulation (Adams Car), it is only really necessary to include the first part, as the second only comes into play due to road surface irregularities. Check this by looking at the damper speeds in the simulation. My gut tells me that you wouldn't really want to end up crossing over from one section of the graph to the other during regular maneuvering.</p><p><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper confluence-embedded-manual-size"><img class="confluence-embedded-image" draggable="false" height="400" src="attachments/130157329/137592937.png" data-image-src="attachments/130157329/137592937.png" data-unresolved-comment-count="0" data-linked-resource-id="137592937" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="attachment" data-linked-resource-default-alias="image2019-12-26_13-22-18.png" data-base-url="https://wiki.itap.purdue.edu" data-linked-resource-content-type="image/png" data-linked-resource-container-id="130157329" data-linked-resource-container-version="19" alt=""></span></p><p><br/></p><p>So there's how dampers can be adjusted, but thinking about them in the context of tuning the vehicle is a bit nastier. In short apply what you know about spring rates to dampers, except that it only occurs in particular transient situations. In any situation, think about which way the shocks are moving (compression vs extension). The corresponding damper settings will make an adjustment to the vehicle's balance on top of the balance from the spring rates. For example, to solve a turn in braking oversteer problem, the options would be to increase the low speed compression damping in the front or decrease the low speed extension rebound damping in the rear. The better choice between those would be dictated by whether you want the car to get over all more responsive or less twitchy. (Note in this case reverse differential settings or brake bias could have also potentially been used. Reverse diff settings are hard to tune, but making sure that the brake bias is in fact far enough forward at the speed of the corner making a problem would be the first thing to check.)</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p>
