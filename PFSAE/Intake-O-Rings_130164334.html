                    <p>In 2018 a custom, cut-to-length o-ring was used to seal from the plenum to the runners, this did not seal properly and had a vacuum leak. This was remedied by applying electrical tape to the outside of the seal and this sealed the intake.</p><p>In 2019 grey RTV was used to seal the runners to the plenum and plenum to diffuser. This caused no issues. It should be considered that if the intake needed to be disassembled and assembled quickly 5 minute RTV should be used and kept on hand should the situation arise.</p><p>O-rings are used to seal the throttle body to the diffuser because it needs to be removable so that the restrictor size can be checked a tech inspection. A size ___ O-ring is used on the 2018, 2019, 2020 intakes and probably before that as well.<br/>An O-ring is also used to seal and attach the trumpet on to the throttle body. A size ____ O-ring is used. For added insurance safety wire also connects the trumpet to the throttle body in the case that is rattles off, but after a season of 2019 testing, no issues arose from the o-ring attachment.<br/><br/></p><p>A good guide to sizing O-rings can be found on the drive at:Â Z:\2020\5_Powertrain\01_Intake System\as568-standard-size-o-rings</p>
