This creates a partial vacuum and suction to scavenge the cylinder</span></p><p><span>4 - 2 - 1 design boosts mid range power, but max power can be down as much as 5-7% compared to 4 - 1</span></p><p><span>“As the initial charge of burnt gas bursts from the cylinder into the exhaust system, it creates a wave of positive pressure. As it surges into the atmosphere the positive waves dissipates and produces a negative pressure wave (suction), which returns along the exhaust pipe back to the cylinder. The art of exhaust tuning is to determine the length and size of the exhaust pipe for this suction wave to arrive back at the cylinder during the valve overlap period.”</span></p><p><span>Header Pipe diameter fixes the velocity of exhaust gas through the pipe</span></p><ul><li><span>Larger pipes move the peak torque higher in rpm range</span></li><li><span>Peak torque at mean gas velocity of 250 ft/sec</span></li></ul><p><br/></p><p><span>Changing the lengths of the pipes tends to “rock” the power curve</span></p><ul><li><span>Longer is better for low and mid-range power</span></li><li><span>Shorter for top end power</span></li></ul><p><br/></p><p><span>Unequal Length Pipes</span></p><ul><li><span>Tunes the torque peak for each cylinder at different rpm so as to flatten the torque curve</span></li><li><span>In restricted classes, equal length primaries are more important because excess power is not an issue</span></li></ul><p><br/></p><p><span>The Collector’s Influence</span></p><ul><li><span>The collector can only boost torque at engine rpm below the torque peak</span></li></ul><p><br/></p><p><span>Once past torque peak rpm there is not enough time for the primary tube to “empty” of exhaust gasses, so it cannot pull a “vacuum”. And if they were made shorter it would kill bottom end power.</span></p><p><br/></p><p><span>Cutting Down on Noise</span></p><ul><li><span>Conventional thinking is to make the most power and then worry about silencing it, but taking time to see what works and doesn’t will yield better results</span></li><li><span>Look at rules and do what you can to point the exhaust away from a noise gun</span></li><li><span>If mufflers appear to increase power it is because the cylinder is being over-scavenged</span></li><li><span>High performance road mufflers performed the best, S flow glass packs as well</span></li><li><span>Glass packs do not create as much back pressure but have a short lifespan in racing environments</span></li></ul>
