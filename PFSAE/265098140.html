What exactly do the hubs do? What other systems to you interact with? </p><p><br/></p><p><strong>Design Requirements</strong></p><ol><li>Rules NEED to be considered. What type of fasteners do the hubs need to have? What does this entail when selecting your fasteners? Do our hub nuts need to be hard anodized? What about the hubs? Why or why not? etc.</li><li>What are the thermal requirements of the system? this is where to define them. just whipped up this confluence page for temp stickers from pf23. <a href="Temp-Stickers-from-PF23_265098143.html">Temp Stickers from PF23</a> </li><li>I think it's reasonable to shoot for no compliance in the system with this. This will help you decide your tolerances and help with tolerance stackups later in the design season. <ol><li>also think about servicability with this statement and incorportate it. like we can just pressfit the bearings onto the hub but we obo don't want </li></ol></li><li>why exactly floating disc brake? did we discuss this with the brakes team? is that what they are going with? if so, how much play do we need to support? its a team effort between hubs and brakes that the floating allowable slop metric is met.</li><li>maybe a little more specific with the drive shaft comment, something like &quot;properly constrains halfshaft under all operating conditions&quot;.</li><li>not only do you want to minimize your weight, but thinking about the fact that the hub is a rotational component, where do you want the majority of the weight to be? </li></ol><p><strong>Design Overview </strong></p><ol><li>I would do the exploration, and present your findings during the DCR. Give yourself a great idea of what bearing we will be using in the design and why</li><li>This would tie into number 4 from above, working with brakes to define the actual floating value</li><li>Asymmetrical hub, maybe? only if you guys find something that is REALLY worth it. otherwise, keep it symmetrical so each hub manufacturing is more worth it if that makes sense</li><li>meeting design criteria and constraints is a given</li><li>Reference the video I will do on Safety factors for this, ill explain how they work in greater detail and why they may not necessarily apply here. </li></ol><p><strong>Manufacturing Overview</strong></p><p>This doesn't apply as you haven't selected your design yet. </p><ul><li>Why do they have to be made on the lathe and mill? Why dont we cast them? Why don't we do 5 axis now that we have the UMC? I wouldn't constrain yourself to the manufacturing methods weve used in the past, they may not be the correct option. </li></ul><p><strong>Cost</strong></p><ul><li>How did you decide the aluminum alloy for each of those?</li></ul><p><strong>Schedule</strong></p><ul><li>These are all &quot;held by&quot; dates, they should be presented before these dates</li><li>It is important to include more into the schedule than major deadlines. Intermediate progress and deadlines should be formulated. Things will change but it is important to mark out all that is involved. This includes Analysis and calculations that need to be done, comparisons and tradeoff due dates, etc.</li></ul><p><br/></p><p>overall good job getting your stuff done early! thats a massive plus. i think overall still lots of work, but that is alright as we are ahead of the deadline quite a bit. strive for super detailed goals, and don't be afraid to expand on the slides given. 100% add more slides. also don't underestimate the power of powerpoint drawings or ipad drawing or just actual sketches on paper for brainstorming items. def include a lot of slides on research and what other teams do as well! very important and could get some inspiration from those. keep remembering to ask yourself &quot;why&quot; for every. single. sentence. you write on your slides. </p><p><br/></p><p><strong>Specific Feedback from DCR Presentation:</strong></p><ul><li>Great to do the research and get initial numbers for material knockdown based on thermal load</li><li>Has there been any initial contact with Drivetrain relating to the sub-team boundaries.<ul><li>Last year they made sleeves</li><li>Contact Aarnav </li></ul></li><li>Considered all aspects and requirements very well</li><li>Is it compliance or is it part failure/play and poor fitment</li><li>Aluminum is sponsored so shows up free</li><li>1 Bearing is probably a bad idea, 2 could allow for smaller and reacts the moment<ul><li>Read through this and try to find other threads talking about FSAE bearings and selection (Take things with a grain of salt, some information might not be right so question and prove for yourself before making a conclusion) <a class="external-link" href="http://www.fsae.com/forums/showthread.php?11598-Bearing-Selection-and-Loads" rel="nofollow">http://www.fsae.com/forums/showthread.php?11598-Bearing-Selection-and-Loads</a></li><li>Stick with our sponsor</li></ul></li><li>Put all tasks/scheduling in teams with deadlines and dates so we can keep tabs on it better</li><li>Answer the question Why 2 bearings in the upright!!!</li></ul><p><br/></p><p>Wheel Centers:</p><ul><li>Optimize to reduce weight and maintain structures</li><li><strong>Good idea to keep 4 wheel studs in same place as previous years to allow for modularity.
