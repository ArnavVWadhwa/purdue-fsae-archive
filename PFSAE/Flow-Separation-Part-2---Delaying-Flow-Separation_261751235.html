I will attempt to explain the 5 mechanism in an easier to understand manner using first principles rather than circulation, but you should still read the paper to get the full picture.</p><ol><li>Slat effect. The forward element turns the flow to be more aligned with the rearward element. Therefore, the stagnation point of the rearward element is optimized.</li><li>Circulation effect. The upwash induced by the rearward element also affects the forward element by improving its attachment since the direction of velocity is more aligned with the direction of the trailing edge of the forward element. Allowing the forward element to achieve higher suction.</li><li>Dumping effect. The flow on the forward element is dumped into a region of lower pressure. Allowing the forward element to achieve higher suction and/or delaying flow separation. </li><li>Off surface pressure recovery. The flow from the forward element is dumped into a region of lower pressure. The low pressure eventually recovers to ambient pressure. Off surface pressure recovery is more efficient since there is no shear stress opposing it.</li><li>Fresh boundary layer. This is prehaps the one that most people think about when talking about multielement wings. The rearward elements get a new boundary layer. Delaying separation and increasing suction. Note that the people including professional aerodynamicists like to use the term &quot;reenergize the boundary layer&quot;. It's not technically correct, since the boundary layer is brand new, not reenergized.</li></ol><p><u><strong>Gurney Flaps</strong></u></p><p><em><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper"><img class="confluence-embedded-image" draggable="false" src="attachments/261751235/261751314.png" data-image-src="attachments/261751235/261751314.png" data-unresolved-comment-count="0" data-linked-resource-id="261751314" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="attachment" data-linked-resource-default-alias="image-2023-5-24_10-10-1.png" data-base-url="https://wiki.itap.purdue.edu" data-linked-resource-content-type="image/png" data-linked-resource-container-id="261751235" data-linked-resource-container-version="1" alt=""></span></em></p><p><em>Gurney flaps</em> delays flow separation by reducing adverse pressure gradient experienced by the airfoil through dumping effect and off surface pressure recovery. The wake produced by the gurney flap is of lower pressure than ambient, so instead of having pressure recover from suction peak to ambient pressure (or near ambient pressure), pressure only needs to recover to the wake pressure. The wake pressure then recovers in an efficient manner to ambient pressure. The reduced adverse pressure gradient not only delays flow separation, but also increases lift produced by the airfoil, since now higher suction can be achieved.</p><p>In addition to delaying flow separation, gurney flaps also increase pressurization on the pressure side, further increasing downforce.</p><p>At extremely high angles of attack near separation, gurneys flaps also reduce drag by providing better boundary layer control, despite the fact that it produces large wakes of its own. However, at low angles of attack, gurney flaps adds a lot drag.</p><p><u><strong>Active Boundary Layer Suction/Blowing</strong></u></p><p>Instead of using pressure gradients to control boundary layers, you can also use powered method.</p><p>One of these methods is suction. Suction is generated either by downwash through microscopic holes on the wall or through a slot big enough to &quot;sallow&quot; the entire boundary layer.</p><p>The other method is boundary layer blowing. Boundary layer is mitigated by injecting high energy flow directly into the boundary layer itself. Although you can just simply eliminate the boundary layer by injecting flow with same speed as outer flow, you could also inject at a high velocity to minimize boundary layer development.</p><p>At Stellantis wing tunnel, they use a combination of the methods not to control separation, but to control boundary layer on the ground going into the test section. Boundary layer control in test section is important since there is no boundary layer on the ground in on track environment. As flow approaches the test section, a slot &quot;sallows&quot; the entire boundary layer. A new boundary layer on top of the slot then starts to develop. After a short distance, there is another slot injecting mass flow at a speed of 1.5x freestream velocity. This combination is able to achieve a boundary layer of 25 mm at the test section.</p><p><u><strong>Pitfalls of Golf Ball Dimples</strong></u></p><p>Everyone's favorite example of flow separation control is golf ball dimples. The idea is that you transition laminar flow to turbulent flow through bumps on the surface. Turbulent flow delays separation and reduce the size of wake behind the golf ball, resulting in reduced drag. This explanation is sound. The problem comes when everyone starts to use dimples to explain everything.</p><p>First of all, dimples don't do anything if the flow is already turbulent. In fact, if flow is already turbulent, the rate of boundary layer growth increases with dimples, resulting in thicker boundary layer and earlier separation, resulting in more drag.</p><p>Second, dimples must be used in a region of adverse pressure gradient, since the mechanism behind dimples is to delay separation. Therefore, if you put a dimple on the nosecone, it will not do anything other than increasing drag.</p><p><u><strong>Pitfalls of Vortex Generators</strong></u></p><p>People like to explain vortex generators either as devices to advance transition of flow from laminar to turbulent, or devices to increase mixing in the boundary layer. Both of the explanation are flat out wrong. </p><p><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper confluence-embedded-manual-size"><img class="confluence-embedded-image" draggable="false" height="250" src="attachments/261751235/261751348.png" data-image-src="attachments/261751235/261751348.png" data-unresolved-comment-count="0" data-linked-resource-id="261751348" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="attachment" data-linked-resource-default-alias="image-2023-5-24_21-32-33.png" data-base-url="https://wiki.itap.purdue.edu" data-linked-resource-content-type="image/png" data-linked-resource-container-id="261751235" data-linked-resource-container-version="1" alt=""></span></p><p>The most common type of vortex generator are counter rotating vortex generator as shown in the picture above. This type of vortex generators generate vorticies in alternating direction. The alternating directions produce bands of flow convergence and bands of flow divergence. In bends of flow divergence, boundary layer is thinned and flow separation delayed. In bends of flow convergence, boundary layer is thickened and flow separation advanced. As the vorticies travel downstream, the size of bands of flow divergence increases and and size of bands of flow convergence decreases because counter rotating pairs are placed close together. What's more, as the converging vortices merge, they start to rise away from the surface, taking some of low energy boundary layer away from the surface, further delaying separation.</p>
