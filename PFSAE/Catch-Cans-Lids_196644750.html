                    <p>Catch cans are containers on the car that are meant to catch either water or oil spit out from either the engine or the cooling system. As the water inside the cooling system gets too hot, the pressure inside the system increases. When the system crosses a certain pressure threshold (32 psi in our case), the pressure cap will open and allow the hot water to leave the system, therefore decreasing the pressure back down below the threshold. This is why we need a catch can to &quot;catch&quot; the water that is pushed out. The oil system has a similar system built in that controls crankcase pressure. This is why both systems require catch cans, and your goal is to design lids that go on top of these catch cans.</p><p>The catch cans we are using for our PF22 car are large aluminum cans. I have included a CAD file of the can below.Â </p><p><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper"><a class="confluence-embedded-file" href="/download/attachments/196644750/Catch_Can.stp?version=1&amp;modificationDate=1637292472000&amp;api=v2" data-nice-type="null" data-file-src="/download/attachments/196644750/Catch_Can.stp?version=1&amp;modificationDate=1637292472000&amp;api=v2" data-linked-resource-id="196644766" data-linked-resource-type="attachment" data-linked-resource-container-id="196644750" data-linked-resource-default-alias="Catch_Can.stp" data-mime-type="application/octet-stream" data-has-thumbnail="false" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-can-edit="true" aria-label="Catch_Can.stp" draggable="false"><img src="download/resources/com.atlassian.confluence.plugins.confluence-view-file-macro:view-file-macro-resources/images/placeholder-small-file.png" height="150" alt="" draggable="false"/><span class="title">Catch_Can.stp</span></a><span class="companion-edit-button-placeholder edit-button-overlay" data-linked-resource-container-id="196644750" data-linked-resource-id="196644766" data-template-name="companionEditIcon" data-source-location="embedded-attachment"></span></span></p><p>These are images of the location of the catch cans.

Reference the rulebook many times as you design your part.</p><p>The last requirement is that the water catch can should be able to pick water back up from the bottom of the can. You need to include this in your design. As the pressure in the cooling system decreases when the water cools down, the water will get sucked up back into the system through the pressure cap. This is important to be able to keep the cooling system filled with water at all times, as more water will mean more mass that can reject the heat from the engine. For example, one situation that this might happen is mid-endurance event. During the event there is a driver change, and during the change the car must be turned off. Because the water pump is mechanically driven, this means that there will be no water flowing through your radiators or engine during this time. The water will get very hot inside the engine and may cross the pressure threshold of the pressure cap, which will spit water out into the catch can. Once the car is turned on and starts driving again, the water will cool back down due to the water flowing through the radiators and the radiators getting air flow. The pressure will decrease and create a vacuum inside the system, and therefore the water will get sucked back into the system. So in conclusion, your lid needs to be able to suck up water from the bottom of the can. Your oil catch can does not need to do this. Also note that the oil and water ventilation fittings are different sizes, so you will end up with two different catch can lids.</p>
