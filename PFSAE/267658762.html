(BIG IDEA)</li></ul><p><strong>Dien's Feedback</strong></p><ul style="list-style-type: square;"><li>Design goals need to be more specific and measurable </li><li>How did you decide on the 20% weight reduction for individual mounts</li><li>Should do a study with driver to determine basis for maximum driver forces </li><li>Running with a carbon fiber throttle pedal will require you to do material testing to validate and verify that the pedal will be able to handle the loading </li><li>How much did PF23 and PF22 brake pedals weigh? Why is the goal of &lt; 3lbs weight chosen? </li><li>Need better definition of system boundaries </li></ul><p><br/></p><ul style="list-style-type: square;"><li>Need to consider costs of carbon fiber manufacturing </li></ul><p><strong>Hunter's Feedback:</strong></p><ul><li>Idk where the extra wire is going to go when switching from max distance from driver to closest position → last year we moved it for tech/judging and then we were given a hard time because BOTS cable was loose. But then how do we move it during design event to fit the small female if it is ziptied? cut it during design?</li><li>There are other methods of securing the pedals than quick inserts</li><li>Tolerances for quick inserts are kinda wonky cant be too much so that there is slop but it was very difficult to get those things out last year</li><li>I am confused a little bit about the cable integration → Which cables are you referring to? → Is it worth?<ul><li>Probably BOTS and remote brake bias if thats something happening</li></ul></li><li>Toe trays developed a lot of slop last year with rivets</li><li>Make sure toe trays fit foot</li><li>I did not see if it said you were in charge of BOTS mounting</li><li>For a single carbon heeltray 7-9 (I don't remember if I did double 0) plys 0-0-45-0-45-0-45-0-0 was okay → deflected a little but did not break but idk that deflection is great if drivers are using it as slight support to press the pedals you'll lose slight responsiveness but that depends on where their feet were cause some didn't put their heels in the little holes so it wouldn't matter</li><li>We will always be able to switch from EBrake Bias to manual even at comp. I am reserving permanent room on the dash. → will not be cut tho so we'd have to drill a hole. Ig we could cut a hole if we wanted and cover it up using Tilton mounting holes for zipties or something</li></ul><p><strong>Helen's Feedback:</strong></p><ul><li>33 slides!</li><li>strong understanding of pedal box body system</li><li>who is responsible for brake lines and what is the plan? seems like it's done last minute in previous years</li><li>is 2000N actually in the rules?<ul><li><a class="confluence-userlink user-mention" data-username="hrumsey" href="https://wiki.itap.purdue.edu/display/~hrumsey" data-linked-resource-id="143757320" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="userinfo" data-base-url="https://wiki.itap.purdue.edu">Rumsey, Helen Nicole</a> yeah but they say don't use it as a design requirement, reference below </li></ul></li><li>how will you achieve no play in brake pedal system</li><li>how much would driver's actually adjust the brake bias during a race?</li><li>fatigue testing of what?</li><li>before switching something like master cylinders think about spares. we want spares and it's nice to use last year's systems as spares</li><li><strong>DCR2</strong></li><li>all very good and detailed. everyone had a good understanding and direction</li><li>i really like the direction you're going in for both the throttle pedal and throttle pedal</li></ul><p><strong>Zach's Feedback:</strong></p><p>pedal box body <a class="confluence-userlink user-mention" data-username="bharadw5" href="https://wiki.itap.purdue.edu/display/~bharadw5" data-linked-resource-id="146773217" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="userinfo" data-base-url="https://wiki.itap.purdue.edu">Bharadwaj, Anirudh Ramasesh</a> </p><ul><li>Design overview<ul><li>&quot;if designed correctly&quot; is a large caveat. generally, more fasteners is more weight, so </li></ul></li><li>analysis<ul><li>what do you mean by hollow inserts?</li></ul></li><li>manufacturing overview isn't needed, watch my video on DCRs on this confluence page <a href="All-Team-Design-Reviews_130162427.html">All Team Design Reviews</a></li><li><s>do we have a schedule for rails / body?</s></li></ul><p>throttle <a class="confluence-userlink user-mention" data-username="eaaltone" href="https://wiki.itap.purdue.edu/display/~eaaltone" data-linked-resource-id="116528109" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="userinfo" data-base-url="https://wiki.itap.purdue.edu">Aaltonen, Emil Johan</a> </p><ul><li>if you're not getting anything from ivan, just continue without him (seems like youve already done this which is good)</li><li>love that you related goals back to chassis goals, could consider relating back to overarching team goals as well </li><li>where are we getting 150?</li><li>lets do a study on what feels like a good throttle pedal? <ul><li>this is more of an ergo thing. im thinking a super simple test bench with a throttle and we maybe put a driving video on a laptop and have the driver push the throttle along with the video. sounds stupid, but how do we know what our upper limit is? in my mind you want the most throttle pedal weight without discomforting the driver</li><li>there are more important things like this, this study would be a nice to have and not a minimum viable product.</li></ul></li><li>were going to have to really know our carbon structures in order to pull off the carbon pedal. <ul><li>there are almost certainly square carbon tubes on the market that we would use for this with some possible modification, making carbon tubes as far as I know is quite tricky. </li></ul></li></ul><p>brake pedal <a class="confluence-userlink user-mention" data-username="imaninga" href="https://wiki.itap.purdue.edu/display/~imaninga" data-linked-resource-id="187075772" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="userinfo" data-base-url="https://wiki.itap.purdue.edu">Maningas, Isaiah</a> </p><ul><li>i wouldn't use BOTS as an acronym - its a safety critical component and better to just say type it out so it is extremely clear what we are talking about</li><li><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper confluence-embedded-manual-size"><img class="confluence-embedded-image" draggable="false" height="150" src="attachments/267658762/267659302.png" data-image-src="attachments/267658762/267659302.png" data-unresolved-comment-count="0" data-linked-resource-id="267659302" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="attachment" data-linked-resource-default-alias="image-2023-7-29_0-31-50.png" data-base-url="https://wiki.itap.purdue.edu" data-linked-resource-content-type="image/png" data-linked-resource-container-id="267658762" data-linked-resource-container-version="9" alt=""></span></li><li>rules say that we shouldn't use 2000 N as a design requirement</li><li>this should be based on what the human body is capable of producing.
