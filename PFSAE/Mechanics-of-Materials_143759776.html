                    <p>This set of pages will quickly go through the main topics of statics (ME 270) and mechanics of materials (ME 323). It is not a substitute for either class, but it pulls the most important topics for understanding the theory needed to design and test structural carbon (and is also useful in other circumstances). This guide should be used as a starting point and a reference for these topics. Throughtout this section, there will be references in the form of [#]. Go to the references page for more information on each of these sources.</p><p><br/></p><h2 id="MechanicsofMaterials-MotivationforLearningThis">Motivation for Learning This</h2><p>In Statics and Dynamics, you will assume that all bodies are rigid and do not deform. This makes calculations easier, but less accurate. In those classes, you will learn about how forces are affecting the motion (or lack thereof) of bodiesÂ [2].</p><p class="Review1" style="margin-left: 0.0in;">Mechanics of Materials is a basic engineering science that deals with the relation between externally applied load and its effect on deformable bodies. The main purpose of Mechanics of Materials is to answer the question of which requirements have to be met to assure STRENGTH, RIGIDITY, AND STABILITY of engineering structures [3].</p>
