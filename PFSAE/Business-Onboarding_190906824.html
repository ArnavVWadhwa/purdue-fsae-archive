I plan to develop the team's position within the University as well with events and other initiatives which you would be helping plan and facilitate. You may also be involved in creating the Business Presentation for the knowledge event in the Spring as well as the marketing side of the team. As such, this onboarding is designed to identify your interests and how you can best help the team. I really appreciate your suggestions and feedback and am committed to making the Business Sub-team an experience which develops your marketing and networking skills. Reach out at any time with any questions. </p><p><br/></p><p>– Athreya Ramanan</p><p>venka118@purdue.edu</p><p><br/></p>
