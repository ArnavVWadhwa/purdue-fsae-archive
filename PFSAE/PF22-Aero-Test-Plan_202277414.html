                    <p>This test should be conducted at the Purdue Grand Prix track or at Grissom. Ross-Ade is too small to maintain the speeds needed for this test. The Grand Prix straight can work at the top of 2nd gear (R6) if the test is run in both directions and wind direction/speed is known. Grissom can be run with a headwind/tailwind set of runs for a long distance to average out the bumpy surface.</p><p>Part 1: Non-aero ClA control run (the car should be brought to the track with no/minimal aero mounted)</p><ol><li>Measure shock pot position with the car at rest, no aero, ideally out of the wind</li><li>Drive at the top of 2nd/3rd/4th (highest gear that can be used, space allowing) in a straight line. At the GP track this will be one direction on the straight, at Grissom this will be into the wind. Repeat 3 times.</li><li>Perform the same test, but in the opposite direction to control for wind direction. Repeat 3 times.</li></ol><p>Part 2: Non-aero CdA control run</p><ol><li>Bring the car up to the top of 2nd/3rd/4th (again, highest gear that can be used). Engage the clutch and let the car coast down to a stop or very low speed. Do this in the same direction as the ClA test. Repeat 3 times.</li><li>Perform the same test, but in the opposite direction. Repeat 3 times.</li></ol><p>Mount the entire aero package onto the car. this is probably a good time to break for lunch</p><p>Part 3: Aero ClA run</p><ol><li>Measure shock pot position with the car at rest, ideally out of the wind. This will control for the added weight of the aero package</li><li>Drive at the top of 2nd/3rd/4th (highest gear that can be used, space allowing) in a straight line. At the GP track this will be one direction on the straight, at Grissom this will be into the wind. Repeat 3 times.</li><li>Perform the same test, but in the opposite direction to control for wind direction. Repeat 3 times.</li></ol><p>Part 4: Aero CdA run</p><ol><li>Bring the car up to the top of 2nd/3rd/4th (again, highest gear that can be used). Engage the clutch and let the car coast down to a stop or very low speed. Do this in the same direction as the ClA test. Repeat 3 times.</li><li>Perform the same test, but in the opposite direction. Repeat 3 times.</li></ol><p><br/></p><p>Added ClA will be determined by the additional displacement on the shock pots when comparing the non-aero and aero runs</p><p>Added Cd &quot;should&quot; be determined by looking at the coast down curve. My best guess at this currently is to take the derivative of the velocity curve to get an acceleration curve, and then plot acceleration vs velocity. This curve should roughly quadratic shaped. The 2nd order term in the quadratic line of best fit should correspond to the aerodynamic force on the car, assuming that frictional forces are all proportional to velocity, constant, or negligible</p>
