                    <p><strong>Zach's Feedback:</strong></p><ul><li>great job relating these back to the main team goals</li><li>how are you going to make sure that the components won't fail? also, nothing is industructable, so what's out limit?</li><li>how can we define crowded? i know it seems nitpicky, but if the driver accidentally hits the wrong button that could end our endurance and loose us significant points</li><li>great job defining the things wrong with last year</li><li>I like the thinking of just removing the component: the best part is a part that isn't there if its not needed</li><li>how are we doing to make sure the dash would still be waterproof without the backing? <ul><li>lets consider doing some failure testing by dunking the harness peice in some water and making sure it still functions</li></ul></li><li>love the different layout schematics, simple yet effective</li><li>i think with the smaller layouts we would still want the estop on the outside, safer for everyone involved</li><li>thank you for putting actual dates on the schedule</li></ul><p><br/></p><p><strong>Hunter's Feedback:</strong></p><ul><li>Some of the requirements could be slightly better defined such as how we define easily accessible</li><li>Good to compare the two options → Could do it in a way that really shows one option vs another</li><li>If no backing buttons can <em>technically </em>go wherever</li><li>Harness being tied to FRH or equivalent will help tremendously with strain relief and vibration resistance</li><li>It will be IMPERATIVE that we make sure everything is fully sealed if we do not use backing</li><li>Not that last years works but that the current drivers are used to it</li><li>Carbon is not heavy enough to justify cramped buttons imo → Great job thinking about the mounting of each layout<ul><li>Also pros and cons of each listed is very nice → Would be good to have all of them together at the end</li></ul></li><li>We should have a w/ owned column and a total column so we know the cost for cost report and the cost to the team</li><li>X for schedule is hard to see → The colors work a little better imo</li></ul>
