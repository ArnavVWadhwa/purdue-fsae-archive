                    <p>There are several types of layups that are used to manufacture carbon fiber components. This page will go into detail on each type and comment on any experience that we have had with them.</p><p><strong><u>Wet Layup</u></strong></p><p>Wet layups are the most basic form of making CFRP components.</p><p><br/></p><p>The procedure to make them is as follows:</p><ol><li>Prepare mold surface with wax and any release agents required.</li><li>Place carbon into mold.</li><li>Mix resin and apply to carbon by hand or with spreaders - make sure you are wearing gloves.</li><li>(Optional) Vacuum bag the part and cure at room temp.</li></ol><p>Below are comments on each step.</p><p><br/></p><p><strong>Step 1 - Mold prep</strong></p><p>This explanation will likely be copied to each type of layup as this is similar regardless of the layup process. Regardless of the mold type, the mold should be sanded to 2000 grit or higher to improve surface finish and help with part removal. Sanding the mold is far easier than sanding a finished component, especially considering how carcinogenic carbon dust is. Duratec 707-002 with MEKP catalyst was used through 2019 with good results, and can be polished fair easily assuming that the mold surface underneath is free of dust or porosity. Glass molds in our experience (2018-2020) are very difficult to keep clean after 2-3 layups and are very easy to break as well. For flat plates, 1/4&quot; Cast Al plates are flat and fairly cheap and don't break when dropped. These should be sanded to 220 grit to remove tooling marks, and then polished to 2000 grit to get a nice surface finish. Al plates also have the advantage of being able to be cured in an oven if plates need to pull double duty as room temp and prepreg curing surfaces. </p><p>For room temp layups (wet, vartm), we have been using a fibre glast wax. I (tyler green) don't know a whole lot about it other than the fact that it works well enough for us. I've heard good things about Rexco Partall paste, but I don't know if there are any real advantages to replacing our large stock of fibre glast cans. When the wax is applied to the mold use a terry cloth (not harbor freight red discount rags or similar) that won't leave fibers on the surface. Wipe it on in circular sweeps and make sure that the entire surface is covered. Wait around 1 minute before buffing it off. For brand new molds, 3-4 layers usually is the correct amount. Once a mold has been used 2-3 times (this really only applies to flat layup plates for endplates) 1 layer of wax should be enough. Make sure that vacuum tape is on the surface before waxing, since you won't be able to stick it down to waxed areas. </p><p><br/></p><p><strong>Step 2 - Laying down carbon</strong></p><p>Twill - The main thing to watch with twill is distortion of the weave. For bodywork and non-structural parts this is only an aesthetic concern, but for structural components changes in the direction of the fibers will affect your material properties. Cutting the carbon to shape and wetting on the mold is highly recommended, since the fabric can be tacked down to avoid the weave shifting. </p><p>Spread Tow - This is a lot easier to work with than twill for maintaining the fiber directions, but can be a pain with curves. Cutting the fabric to shape again helps quite a bit.</p><p><br/></p><p><strong>Step 3 - Apply Resin</strong></p><p>going to skip this for now, this is pretty basic stuff</p><p><br/></p><p><strong><u>Infusion/VARTM</u></strong></p><p>Infusion or VARTM layups are a layup type that uses the pump to draw resin through the part through a bag. This method is more complex and resource intensive than a wet layup but should result in parts that have nearly the same resin content and mechanical properties to equivalent prepreg.</p><p>The procedure is as follows:</p><ol><li>Apply vacuum tape to edge of mold</li><li>Prepare mold surface</li><li>Place carbon into mold</li><li>Place release plies and flow media</li><li>Vacuum bag the part and seal any leaks</li><li>Introduce resin into part</li><li>Seal vacuum lines and cure</li></ol><p>Obviously there are more steps than a wet layup. Below are comments</p><p><br/></p><p><strong>Step 0 - Layup order (top to bottom)</strong></p><ul style="list-style-type: square;"><li>Bag</li><li>Flow media/infusion mesh</li><li>Release ply (peel ply or perf release)</li><li>Carbon</li><li>Release (wax or frekote)</li><li>Mold surface</li></ul><p><br/></p><p><strong>Step 1 - Vacuum tape</strong></p><p>There are a couple ways of doing this. If the mold is small enough or too complex to bag normally, the entire mold can be sealed in one bag (i.e. wing elements in size, bodywork in complexity). While this wastes bag and tape, it saves quite a bit of time and effort not having to make pleats in odd locations. The size of the bag depends on the mold shape and size, but generally a bag twice the footprint of the mold will not have any problems conforming to all of the geometry. If the entire mold is being bagged, vacuum tape and bag should be done later (at step 5)</p><p>If the bag is being applied over the top of the mold (flat plates, shallow molds, really large molds), tape needs to be put down before the mold is prepared for layup. If wax/mold release is applied first, the vacuum tape won't stick down properly and you will need to re bag the part. Leave 1-2in of space between the bag and where the finished part will be. Forethought in mold design is key to prevent issues.</p><p><br/></p><p><strong>Step 2 - Prepare mold surface</strong></p><p>This is the same process as wet layup, see above section. If you're oven curing the part, frekote should be used instead of paste wax unless it's rated to the cure temp. Warming parts to cure (i.e. tent, heating lamp) to below 150F shouldn't give any problems. Most of all just read the datasheet for your release.</p><p><br/></p><p><strong>Step 3 - Place carbon into mold</strong></p><p>Again, similar to wet layup. Take more care looking at how the fabric will sit in the mold if it isn't being tacked down. Since the carbon will still be dry when the vacuum is being pulled, there is a higher chance of things shifting around. Tacking down the fabric or at least taping the edges is a must.</p><p><br/></p><p><strong>Step 4 - Release plies/flow media</strong></p><p>This is where most issues with infusion come up. These layers, along with mold geometry will determine your resin flow. This is super important for complex geometry and will determine whether or not the part is fully wetted.</p><p>Release ply - With release ply there are really 2 options. Peel ply will give you a surface finish that is ideal for secondary bonding but is a pain to demold. Perf release will give a subjectively nicer aesthetic (I prefer peel ply) and is easier to demold but will need to be sanded before anything is being bonded. Try to avoid having double layers or folds in the release ply. This can affect your resin flow significantly and lead to dry spots.</p><p>Notes:</p><p>If you have large parts and don't want to deal with pulling off peel ply and flow media full of resin. Perf release can be put over the top of your peel ply. You will need to infuse more resin that will be wasted, but for thin parts that can be damaged by the process of pulling off the flow media this may be worth it. For parts with complex geometry this also applies. </p><p>Leave 0.5-1 inch of peel ply hanging over the edge of the carbon. This will help to start removing the flow media, as you can make a cut and tear the peel ply.</p><p><br/></p><p>Flow media - without question this is the single most important aspect of a VARTM layup. You will need to make sure that the position and layering of your mesh, spiral tubing, and inlet/outlet ports will wet the entire part. </p><p>The first layer you will need to lay down is infusion mesh. Green mesh (airflow? airmesh? greenmesh?) from airtech works fine. There are fancy meshes out there, but the green mesh is cheap and hasn't given us any problems. The mesh should cover all of the carbon but shouldn't be overhanging the release ply.  Mesh will take about 700gsm of resin, which is the biggest downside of infusion. For our flat plates, we are wasting anywhere from 50 to 80 percent of our resin based on how much carbon is wasted after trimming and how many plies are in the part.</p><p><br/></p><p>Port layout/spiral tubing - The location of these will largely determine the outcome of your part. There need to be at least 2 ports, 1 for resin to flow in and 1 for the vacuum to draw it out. We haven't tried running parts with more than 1 inlet or outlet, but it is something that may be attempted with 2020 undertray. For a basic layup (relatively flat and rectangular) you will want one side of the part to be the inlet side, the opposite to be the outlet side. Underneath the inlet port, spiral tubing should be taped down to run along the entire edge with the port in the center. On the opposite side, a 2nd layer of flow media should be placed underneath, again with the port in the center. The layer should be around 2-3 inches wide and go across the entire edge. This is all to make sure that the resin flows in an even line across the part from edge to edge, rather than a stream directly from one port to the other. This method so far hasn't been tried on parts larger than around 30 inches in their largest dimension, but I will update this with the results from the undertray. This is a planned 2020 layup that will be approx 60&quot; long and 24&quot; wide.</p><p><br/></p><p><strong>Step 5 - Vacuum Bag</strong></p><p>Next the part should be vacuum bagged. The nice thing about infusion is that you can spend as long as you want sealing the bag and making sure that it is airtight, even going as far as rebagging the part if it isn't good enough. We have taken parts in the past and bagged them one day, left it overnight, and then infused the next if time is short or we want to debulk the plies. If the entire mold is being bagged, this is a pretty simple process. Just set the mold down on the bag, close the bag, and seal all around. If the part is being bagged in the more conventional method with tape on the surface, the bag should still be about 1.5x the size of the mold for flat plates, and even larger for especially deep molds. Pleats should be done at least once on every edge even for flat plates, and on large edges every 12-24 inches. If these aren't done properly, the bag won't be pressing the carbon onto the mold surface and ruin the part. As the vacuum is being pulled, the bag can be shifted to make sure that it is contacting the part in every area. In the worst case, &quot;vacuum bag surgery&quot; can be done to expand problem areas and make the bag a little bigger. Some pictures of this will probably be below later in the year. </p><p>Once the bag is fully pleated and stuck down, a hole should be pierced in both the inlet and outlet and tubing should be attached. I prefer to do both tubes before the vacuum is first pulled, as it makes it easier to seal without going over a fold in the bag. Clamp off the resin side of the bag and connect the vacuum outlet to the resin catch pot. At this point any leaks will be hissing like crazy and pretty easy to find. Every leak needs to be taken care of for a good infusion. If there are leaks in the bag, you will pull air into the part and likely ruin it. If the gauge on the vacuum is reading -30inHg, the bag should be airtight. Clamp off the outlet between the bag and catch pot and close off the catch pot from the pump. Walk away from the part for about 5 minutes minimum (I usually like to clean up and have a snack during this period). Come back and unclamp the outlet hose. If the vacuum gauge stays at -30inHg, the bag is airtight and you're ready for infusion. If not, there are leaks that still need to be found. Don't neglect this step, as finding leaks once resin is infused is almost impossible and wastes all of the materials and time spend getting to this point.</p><p><br/></p><p><strong>Step 6/7 - Infusion</strong></p><p><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper confluence-embedded-manual-size"><img class="confluence-embedded-image" draggable="false" height="250" src="attachments/130158116/132156929.jpg" data-image-src="attachments/130158116/132156929.jpg" data-unresolved-comment-count="0" data-linked-resource-id="132156929" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="attachment" data-linked-resource-default-alias="ee2.jpg" data-base-url="https://wiki.itap.purdue.edu" data-linked-resource-content-type="image/jpeg" data-linked-resource-container-id="130158116" data-linked-resource-container-version="10" alt=""></span></p><p>VARTM parts take a lot more resin than standard wet layup components. In 2019, we usually would be mixing 60% of carbon weight as resin, and saw almost all of it in the final part. With infusion, you will be mixing 50% of the carbon weight plus 700g for every square meter of infusion mesh, as well as an extra 100g for tubes and ports. For a standard 300gsm endplate, more than 70% of your resin will end up in the garbage. This is part of the cost of making lighter parts.</p><p>All of the resin should be ready for infusion before you introduce it into the part. PTM&amp;W 2712 with the B1 hardener has a 2 hour pot life, so you can take the time to degas the resin and mix more if it looks like not enough has made it into the part. Resin with a shorter pot life might cause issues with this sort of thing. We like to put the cups on the bag so we can both see what is still left to go and so that there is an indicator of how far along in the cure the resin is after the infusion is done in the form of spilled resin. </p><p>To start the cure, open the vacuum outlet and close off the resin inlet near the port in the bag. Dip the end of the inlet hose into the resin and leave it there. You won't want to take this out of the resin until you clamp the line off once all of the resin is infused. Open the clamp and let the resin start to flow into the part. It should move pretty quick. For a 30&quot;x30&quot; endplate with 3 plies of 88gsm spread tow, we will complete an infusion in about 20 minutes at the longest. </p><p>Once the resin is at the outlet port, it should start to pull out air bubbles that were left in the resin. At this point the resin inlet line should be closed off very tight and can be taken out of the resin. Let the vacuum pull out air bubbles until it is mostly resin that is coming out of the part. Clamp off the vacuum outlet, close off the catch pot, and then shut off the pump. The resin infusion is now finished, and catch pot can be detached and the part should be left to cure. Check the resin manufacturer's TDS for cure times. With PTM&amp;W 2712 B1 we have to wait anywhere from 30 to 50 hours before we can safely demold the part. </p><p><br/></p><p><strong>Infusion notes</strong></p><ul style="list-style-type: square;"><li>Degassing the resin is probably something we should do more. Usually we end up with a lot of bubbles about half way through the part</li><li>Don't use too much tape on the corners of each layer. these can build up and be a pain to get rid of when demolding and anchor the part to the tool</li><li>Big parts might be better infused with the feed line on the longer edges. Haven't really tried this yet</li><li>Yacht rock produces the best parts</li><li>Use the fact that the vacuum only needs to be running for ~1hr to your advantage. This limits your production speed to the number of molds you have rather than how long each part needs to be under vacuum. With wet layups the max is about 3 parts per day, infusion the theoretical max is probably around 20. This would require all of your parts to be ready for infusion prior. Aero in 2020 will likely be doing batches of laying down fabric and sealing 3-4 molds friday night and then infusing saturday morning. This lets parts cure in parallel. Pretty important since our cure time for 2020 to full strength is about 7 to 10 days (PTM&amp;W 2712 A/B1)</li><li>Infusing spread tow has a couple key differences from twill. See the subpage of this one for detailed notes</li></ul><p><br/></p><p><u><strong>Prepreg</strong></u></p><p>Prepreg is fabric with the resin pre-impregnated (pre-preg) to a precise amount. Usually this is about 35-40% resin content. This is the ideal method for laying up components as material properties are far more consistent and the lightest possible parts are made. Since the reaction of epoxy resin is exothermic, prepreg will cure at room temperature if left for long enough. Therefore, it needs to be kept cold to slow the reaction down so it can be stored before it is used. Generally you should be aiming for below 0F. The BIDC freezer is set to at about -10F to -15F at the moment to keep our expired materials good for longer.</p><p>The procedure is far simpler than other layups which is what makes prepreg so handy for complex or large layups. There is no beating the gel time of the resin to bag it before it cures like with a wet layup or figuring out the flow path like with infusion. The downside is that any tool that is used needs to be able to withstand your cure temp. The cure temp will depend on the prepreg, but lower cure temp prepreg cures faster. For example room temp cure prepreg has a short freezer life and outlife and will cure in a few days when taken out of the freezer. 350F can be left out for a couple months and still cure fine. Most of our fabric is 250F cure at the moment, since this is the standard in prepreg materials and is easiest to get from sponsors.</p><p>Procedure:</p><ol><li>Make tool</li><li>Prep mold</li><li>Lay down fabric</li><li>Vacuum bag</li><li>Cure in oven or autoclave</li></ol><p><strong>Step 1 - Make Tool</strong></p><p>The first step to a prepreg part is making a tool that will not break down under the temperatures and pressures that you are curing at. The cure schedule needs to be decided early on in the process so this can all be figured out. For low temperature and pressure cures (&lt;125F, 30inHg) a standard tooling board mold will probably be fine. For the standard FSAE cure (250F max temp, 30inHg pressure) this does not work. There are a few tool material options. Steel or aluminum would be ideal for heavy use tools. The only parts I can think of that we would have a use for with these are steering wheel or wheel/wheel shell. The machining time and cost of material is not worth it for most parts where we are curing 1-2 parts max and then tossing the mold. High temperature tooling board is ideal, but we have a limited supply of this. A good compromise is carbon tools. These have the added benefit of having the same CTE of whatever part it is that you're curing, so things will be nice and easy to demold. Carbon tools will add an extra week of processing time to your part, so keep this in mind. The steps for making these are below:</p><ol><li>Cut a master/plug mold - This is the shape that will define the finished prepreg part. It should have lots of flat areas around the mold. This can be out of standard material, since the cure that takes place on it will happen at room temp. Prepare this in the same way as you would for a wet layup before the tool layup.</li><li>Lay up the tool - From what I've read on other teams, appox 2000gsm is the layup weight that you will need to prevent deformation of the mold under pressure. We are planning on using 1 surface ply of 335gsm twill (for surface finish and conformability to corners) and then 4 plies of 500gsm tooling fabric for our molds. We will use PTM&amp;W 2520 A/B1 resin, since it has a long pot life (5 hours) to allow us to full wet every ply. The layup should be done in 12&quot;x12&quot; squares wetted off of the part, and then draped over. The only exception to this is the surface ply, which we are planning on debulking overnight to our parts in order to avoid bridging. If you are locating holes in the part, pins should be placed into the part before the layup and coated in mold release. Drill bushings should be slid on about half way through the layup. Once the layup is finished, bag the part and let it cure for however long the resin says. With 2520, I believe it is about 2 days to cure to the point where it can be demolded. At this point, the tool should be demolded and checked for any issues. Hopefully there are no voids or issues with bridging.</li><li>Post cure the tool - Straight off the mold the tool will not be able to cure parts at a high temperature. The tool will need to be postcured to raise its service temperature up past the cure temp of your prepreg. Our plan for 2020 is to post cure all of our tools to 350F, to make them compatible with all of our prepreg. This process takes about 24 hours in the oven.</li></ol><p>At this point, the carbon tool is ready for layup. I would recommend cleaning up the edges before bagging to avoid injury, or worse, puncturing the bag.</p><p><strong>Step 2 - Prep Mold</strong></p><p>This is the same as both previous sections. Just use frekote instead of wax.</p><p><strong>Step 3 - Lay Down Fabric</strong></p><p>Again, this is the same as the other sections. It will be easier to lay down since the fabric will have some tack to it that makes it stick easier. </p><p><strong>Prepreg Notes</strong></p><p>You should always debulk your plies in every layup. For layups with lots of plies, a debulk should occur every 3 plies (this can vary based on the total number of plies). Debulking involves laying down the plies and putting them under vacuum to squeeze out the air and ensure that there is adequate compaction between the plies. This helps to prevent delamination between the plies and between the core and laminate if core is being used. The ply order should be plies→release ply→breather→bag. The release ply will depend on if more material is being debulked or cured on top of the plies already laid down. In general, anything that will be bonded or debulked again (i.e. debulks mid-layup, debulks in a multi-stage cure, debulks of skins prior to being laid onto core), peel ply should be used in order to </p>
