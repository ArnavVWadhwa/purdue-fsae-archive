                    <p>This page is going to cover a new method we're trying to get better dimensional accuracy on our airfoils (FW, RW, and SW).</p><p><strong>Old Construction Method</strong></p><ol><li>Place lower skins in their respective molds (to help them keep their shape)</li><li>Attach ribs to the skins using epoxy, and use the set time to get them positioned as accurately as we can.<ol><li>We position them by eye, measure and see if they're where they need to be.</li><li>Note: we also had some waterjet foam &quot;ribs&quot; that were attached between the skins, but they were not visible externally. (Only there for dimensional accuracy and additional attachment between skins).</li></ol></li><li>Add some more epoxy on top, and place the other skin.</li><li>Lift the top skin to see if there's enough epoxy contact for a proper bond.</li><li>If so, place it together, maybe with some weights on top, and let it cure in the mold.</li></ol><p><em>&lt;TODO: Add a sketch of the old method&gt;</em></p><p>The main thing here is the initial placement of the ribs on the skins, which is done by eye. This year, I'm making a set of jigs so that we have better accuracy for rib placement, both across the span and in the lengthwise direction.</p><hr/><p><strong>The concept:</strong></p><p>Make a jig + baseplate system that lets us accurately position the ribs <em>(relative to each</em> <em>other)</em>. Using this, we can position the skin more accurately, and once we trim the excess, we should end up with rib positioning accurate to the mm (approx. 0.04&quot;).</p><p><strong>New construction method:</strong></p><ol><li>Attach the correct jigs to the baseplate using the pre-spaced mounting holes.<ol><li>(Everything uses #8 screws, which are the same ones used in the actual wing construction.)</li></ol></li><li>Attach ribs to the jigs (including #8 spacers)<ol><li><em>&lt;TODO: Add spacer dimensions / part #&gt;</em></li><li>We use the spacers so that any excess epoxy doesn't glue the skins to the jigs.</li></ol></li><li>Attach one skin to the ribs (epoxy, etc.) Make sure it is positioned correctly on the ribs.</li><li>Let dry (enough).</li><li>Flip the wing and attach to the jigs again, with the already-attached skin flipped &lt;<em>TODO: Insert sketch/image</em>&gt;</li><li>Attach the other skin in a similar manner.</li><li>Theoretically, we now have the most dimensionally accurate rib positioning we've ever had.</li></ol><p><em>&lt;TODO: Add a sketch of the new method&gt;</em></p><hr/><p>The rib hole spacing has been consolidated to minimize the number of unique jigs to be made. As of now, there should be:</p><p>A pair of  &quot;<strong>GIGA&quot; </strong>Plates, with holes for:</p><ol><li>FW Inner Flaps</li><li>FW Outer Flaps</li><li>SW Flap 1</li><li>SW Flap 2</li><li>RW Mainplane</li><li>RW Flap 1</li><li>RW Flap 2</li></ol><p>And some extra, bespoke plates for the inner ribs of the FW and RW mainplanes.</p><hr/><p>Quick notes about the design:</p><ul><li>All span measurements are from the outside of their respective ribs.<br/>All chord measurements refer to the furthest distance between two screw holes for any given rib.</li><li>Screw holes are as follows:<ul><li>Baseplate gets 0.1360&quot; holes (#29), 8-32 screw tapping drills</li><li>Gigaplates get 0.1695&quot; holes (#18), close fit clearance drills.</li><li><em><a class="external-link" href="http://www.csgnetwork.com/screwnummachtable.html" rel="nofollow">Number Machine Screws Tap Drills Chart (csgnetwork.com)</a></em></li></ul></li><li>Spacers are 0.25&quot; thick (assumed, we have some lying around apparently)</li></ul><p> <a class="external-link" href="https://wright.nasa.gov/airplane/geom.html" rel="nofollow"><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper confluence-embedded-manual-size"><img class="confluence-embedded-image confluence-content-image-border" draggable="false" width="350" src="attachments/198509693/202277927.png" data-image-src="attachments/198509693/202277927.png" data-unresolved-comment-count="0" data-linked-resource-id="202277927" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="attachment" data-linked-resource-default-alias="image2022-1-6_12-46-42.png" data-base-url="https://wiki.itap.purdue.edu" data-linked-resource-content-type="image/png" data-linked-resource-container-id="198509693" data-linked-resource-container-version="12" alt=""></span></a></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p>
