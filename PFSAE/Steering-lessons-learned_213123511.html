There are many types of bearings out there but in our steering assembly, we used needle roller bearings, originally we went with open needle roller bearings without realizing that open bearings start to bind when exposed to the outdoors (Rust). We had to redo a whole steering column to change to a sealed bearing design since the car drove in the rain and seizing become noticeable.</span></li><li><span class="s1"> <span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper confluence-embedded-manual-size"><img class="confluence-embedded-image" draggable="false" height="150" src="attachments/213123511/217486267.png" data-image-src="attachments/213123511/217486267.png" data-unresolved-comment-count="0" data-linked-resource-id="217486267" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="attachment" data-linked-resource-default-alias="Screen Shot 2022-05-01 at 7.55.11 PM.png" data-base-url="https://wiki.itap.purdue.edu" data-linked-resource-content-type="image/png" data-linked-resource-container-id="213123511" data-linked-resource-container-version="9" alt=""></span></span></li><li><span class="s1">Make sure to properly lubricate the bearings since lubrication is important for fatigue of bearing and it is hard to lubricate the bearings when the column is assembled</span></li><li><span class="s1">Use heat sync compound for all welds, each weld in our assembly was close to a component with grease</span></li><li><span class="s1">Try to redesign the bearing supports and steering assembly so that maintenance can be done without having to totally lose a steering column (and spline which is very expensive)</span></li><li><span class="s1">One way this might be possible is if the bearing sleeve holders were not full enclosures. This would have let us service the steering without having to order brand new parts. Most likely with a more serviceable system, the structures are also more complex</span></li><li><span class="s1">Make sure to account for electronic wires throughout the assembly (Steering rack cover will need to be designed after all plumbing, etc is in cad.)</span></li><li><span class="s1">A lock collar was used on the front face of the first bearing sleeve to prevent linear movement of the steering column tube.</span></li></ul><p><span class="s1">welding....</span></p><ul><li><span class="s1">tighten bolts to torque </span></li><li><span class="s1">measure measure measure, the linear position of rack (needs to be centered for multiple on car welds as well as steering wheel)</span></li><li><span class="s1">weld slowly</span></li><li><span class="s1">use paste</span></li></ul><p><br/></p><p>One issue that was run into was roll pin walking. This means throughout cyclic loading the roll pins in the steering rack adapter started to walk off-center. This pdf goes into depth about why roll pins and some ways to prevent it. The reason our pins walked was due to uneven loading happening from the twisted bearing sleeve support. An angular force vector is created from the bending and ends pushing roll pins.</p><p><br/></p><p><a class="external-link" href="https://www.spirol.com/assets/files/Why_Pins_Walk_and_How_to_Ensure_that_Doesnt_Happen_us.pdf" rel="nofollow">https://www.spirol.com/assets/files/Why_Pins_Walk_and_How_to_Ensure_that_Doesnt_Happen_us.pdf<span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper confluence-embedded-manual-size"><img class="confluence-embedded-image" draggable="false" height="250" src="attachments/213123511/214144315.png" data-image-src="attachments/213123511/214144315.png" data-unresolved-comment-count="0" data-linked-resource-id="214144315" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="attachment" data-linked-resource-default-alias="Screen Shot 2022-04-04 at 7.58.02 PM.png" data-base-url="https://wiki.itap.purdue.edu" data-linked-resource-content-type="image/png" data-linked-resource-container-id="213123511" data-linked-resource-container-version="9" alt=""></span><span class="s1"><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper confluence-embedded-manual-size"><img class="confluence-embedded-image confluence-thumbnail" draggable="false" height="250" src="attachments/213123511/214144420.png" data-image-src="attachments/213123511/214144420.png" data-unresolved-comment-count="0" data-linked-resource-id="214144420" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="attachment" data-linked-resource-default-alias="Screen Shot 2022-04-04 at 11.15.20 PM.png" data-base-url="https://wiki.itap.purdue.edu" data-linked-resource-content-type="image/png" data-linked-resource-container-id="213123511" data-linked-resource-container-version="9" alt=""></span></span></a></p><p><br/></p><p>These are notes for when we redid the steering column</p><p><br/></p><p>Plan for Tuesday and steering rerun,</p><p><br/></p><p>the column was saved lets gooo, shoutout dom and helen</p><p><br/></p><p>Things to think about</p><ul><li>steering rack and column bending </li><li>mounts</li></ul><p><br/></p><p>Tuesday Morning </p><ul><li>Steering rack remove if needed</li><li>Dry fit bearing sleeves - Sand down until they fit first priority</li><li>Press bearings in</li><li>Clean off column - debur</li><li>Align and fasten bearings sleeves well and straight - <p class="p1"><span class="s1">Remember to think about how bearing sleeves go into the holder, also concentrically sand and check one of the bearing fit, check if tight lock is needed</span></p></li><li><span class="s1">Pin steering rack - Decide about adapter machining if needed think about changing hole size from article maybe smaller on outside</span></li><li><span class="s1">dry fit decide what holes and shortening of top tube or other tubes</span></li><li><span class="s1">(maybe figure out a way to measure assembly so it becomes similar to cad but probably away from it at this point)</span></li><li><span class="s1">replace hardware</span></li></ul><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p>
