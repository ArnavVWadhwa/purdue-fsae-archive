a couple different methods all internal to the disk and transmission case</span><span> </span></li></ul><ul><li><span>Varying the spring stiffness via OEM kits, this will increase the force/engine rpm

customizability for data to use in the lapsim handled by Suspension</span><span> </span></li><li><span>The use of the lapsim to determine the possible gain of throttle on time as a result of clutch engagement rpm</span><span> </span></li><li><span>Use of the auto clutch during testing sessions, typically this would result in the tuning of the clutch which would require removing the engine and disassembling the transmission case either out on the track or at the end of the day.</span><span> </span></li></ul></li></ul><p><span> </span></p><p><span>Analyzing the use case of Accel event runs:</span><span> </span></p><ul><li><span>The auto clutch system can give you consistent clutch engagement during an accel run however you also must realize that launching the car and travelling through a low-speed corner are two very different operations which would have their own desirable engagement rpms. This means you either have to change the springs in the auto clutch between events or go for a configuration that allows for the use of a clutch handle for accel runs.</span><span> </span></li></ul><p><span> </span></p><p><span>Overall Conclusion:</span><span> </span></p><p><span>Everything about this clutch system points to “ease of use” for newer drivers and motocross enthusiasts to eliminate the thought of clutching in and out while driving their bikes. In the realm of Formula SAE it comes out to be something similar as it would make driving a lot simpler and easier but wouldn’t offer many performance benefits given current data (the lapsim could tell us different). Regarding acceleration runs we would need to tune the clutch alongside a torque curve however you would then run into the issue of having the clutch engage at the same rpm as it would during acceleration runs.</span><span> </span></p><p><span>Personally, I’d recommend that we focus on tuning and integrating the WR450F before we investigate an auto clutch for performance as we currently have drivers that can handle using the clutch during normal operations. However this does not mean that integrating it for ease of use is a bad idea, it ultimately falls to the Powertrain Lead and the Chief Engineer to determine whether they want the clutch system.</span><span> </span></p>
