Background</span></h3><p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);">The CFD techniques utilized for the 2018-2019 season build upon the work done in previous years, especially 2017-2018. Throughout 2017-2018 a 10 mn cell K-e half-car simulation at the default ride height, roll, pitch, and yaw with surface and volumetric refinements operating at 15 m/s was utilized for essentially all of the design work. A wall y+ of approximately 30 was targeted. Convergence times hovered at around 4 hrs on the Radon cluster. Minimal usage of batch scripts or Macro automation was used, beyond part specific optimization scripts. Occasional K-w transient simulations were used to ensure reasonable results were achieved when using a conceptually better turbulence model for our purposes, with full car yaw, pitch, and roll simulations conducted post design deadline. All of the meaningful simulation work conducted in 2017-2018 was full (half) car 3D. Approximately 5 baseline simulation environments were constructed, each corresponding to updates in baseline geometry or simulation set-up. These baseline simulations allowed new part designs to be tested A/B against a previous iteration while preserving the rest of the full-car geometry. Overall, around 100 simulations were conducted in total throughout the 2017-2018 season.</span></p><h3 id="TutorialsandWorkflow-2.Objectives"><span>2.

Workflow automation</span></h3><p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);">The STAR-CCM+ macro recorder, the STAR-CCM+ Java API, and the InteliJ IDEA IDE were used to develop a suite of Java macros to automate the entire simulation preprocessing (after geometry import), solving, and postprocessing workflows. Prior to this year, each simulation would require approximately 1 hour of user interaction for simulation set-up and simulation post processing. These macros reduced that user interaction requirement down to the couple minutes it takes to import a STEP file into STAR and update the parts folder within STAR. The inbuilt recorder cannot be used to build a complete suite of macros, as the macros generated by the inbuilt recorder require part and surface names to be identical for every simulation run. This is highly impractical, as the number of surfaces and parts is never a constant through an aero design cycle.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);">Fundamentally, these macros work by reading part names from the parts folder to recognize each component on the car, and subsequently assign them to the correct surface controls, regions, and reports. These macros can only work if a naming convention is strictly followed. For 2018-2019, abbreviations were used as prefixes for every component in the CAD and in the CFD environment (FW, RW, SW, NS, EC, MOUNT, CFD). These abbreviations were hardcoded into the macros, enabling each macro to correctly recognize parts. These macros can be found at the time of this writing in </span><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);">Z:\2019\7_Aerodynamics\CFD\Future reference\Base 19 macros</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);">Beyond automating STAR-CCM+ itself, once supercomputer access was regained by the team, the power of shell and batch scripts quickly became apparent. At the end of the design cycle, the team figured out how to queue simulations into the PBS queue on the scholar cluster the right way. This allowed the team to set up batch scripts that execute the STAR-CCM+ macros, and submit them to the PBS queue. As the set-up time for each simulation is incredibly short, this allowed the team to be able to run as many simulations as desired. Simulation time was no longer a constraint, as sims could be queued up ad infinitum and processed as soon as cores were available. It is strongly recommended to future aero teams to avoid doing any post processing on the RCAC cluster hardware. This can be done on local hardware a lot faster than on the RCAC clusters due to a lack of GPU nodes. Templates for Linux and Windows scripts are also available in  </span><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);">Z:\2019\7_Aerodynamics\CFD\Future reference\Base 19 macros</span></p><h4 id="TutorialsandWorkflow-3.1Futureworkforworkflowautomation"><strong><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);">3.1 Future work for workflow automation</span></strong></h4><p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);">Unfortunately, a lot of these macros ended up being lumps of spaghetti code. The first few macros such as the macro for the automated mesh operation were simple modifications of the code generated by the inbuilt STAR-CCM+ recorder. Some of the macros had to be quickly janked together at 3am to work for full-car simulations, as they had initially only been written with half-car in mind, resulting in more spaghetti. A few of the macros which were written from scratch, and feature meaningful variable names can be easily followed. Essentially, all of these macros should be rewritten. It is advised to not use the inbuilt STAR-CCM+ recorder for anything other than to figure out which API functions correspond to STAR-CCM+ UI functions, since the the STAR-CCM+ API documentation isn’t the easiest document to work with, and the STAR-CCM+ recorder otherwise produces terrible code. The post processing macros were written in a way where the FW, RW, UT, car sweeps happen within separate macros. Running the entire post processing macro takes around 40 minutes, which could easily be reduced by having a better order of scene extraction. </span></p><h3 id="TutorialsandWorkflow-4.Simulationenvironment-philosophy"><span>4. Simulation environment - philosophy</span></h3><p><span><br/></span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);">A wall Y+ of 30 was targeted using the K-e turbulence model. This was selected to avoid resolving any of the buffer region, and due to a lack of time to fully develop a k-w or SA setup that fully resolves the boundary layer with a wall Y+ &lt; 5. Mesh sizing varied substantially throughout the design cycle, varying from 4.5 mn cells up to 10 mn cells per half-car. Approximately 20 baseline simulations were built throughout the design cycle, each featuring either updated geometry or updates in the simulation set-up. Occasional mesh independence studies were conducted by varying the base cell size of the mesh, and mesh counts were updated depending to minimize simulation time without compromising on the mesh independence on the performance characteristic in focus at the time (ie, downforce, or mass flow, or front%). These baseline simulations were set-up solely by the team lead, to ensure a consistent simulation environment through all part design iterations. </span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);"><span><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper confluence-embedded-manual-size"><img class="confluence-embedded-image confluence-external-resource" draggable="false" height="329" width="740" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/2JxtFT4OlgzUF2n9F628vDqCD63UhYYKWUJ9NOLMp8zkxmHEWSXBqmxoG5CJWFwGRODC1Rv4W3tNFmHtih16SJmJEH1MLjtjBckmB4TOnx5e40ZBOEkM6ETDDZmZHkPZQc_tTYeB" data-image-src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/2JxtFT4OlgzUF2n9F628vDqCD63UhYYKWUJ9NOLMp8zkxmHEWSXBqmxoG5CJWFwGRODC1Rv4W3tNFmHtih16SJmJEH1MLjtjBckmB4TOnx5e40ZBOEkM6ETDDZmZHkPZQc_tTYeB"></span></span></span></p><h2 id="TutorialsandWorkflow-2019-2020SeasonWorkflow"><strong>2019-2020 Season Workflow</strong></h2><h3 id="TutorialsandWorkflow-1.Background.1">1.

Workflow</strong></h3><h4 id="TutorialsandWorkflow-3.1Introduction"><strong><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);">3.1 Introduction</span></strong></h4><p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);">We’ve made some significant changes to the CFD workflow for 2020. There’s a lot going on, and it might seem like a massive downgrade on the elegant solution we had last year, but the new tools are pretty powerful.</span></p><p><br/><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);">All the macros have been built under the assumption that sims will be run in batch, and will look for system environment variables for certain operations and parameters. I made some attempt to have control flows to handle missing environment variables, but can’t guarantee the protections cover every possible control flow. The short of that is - these macros are meant for batch. Don’t use them for an interactive session. The majority of the code has been written for Linux. Right now Linux support is guaranteed. Chunks of Windows support are in the code, but it isn’t being maintained, and I don’t plan on maintaining it. Too much work for no functional benefit.</span></p><p><br/><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);">In terms of sim set-up, it’s exactly the same as last year. All you need to worry about is ensuring all of your geometry is in the ‘parts’ folder in the STAR-CCM+ workflow, and that you don’t touch anything else in the base sim. I’ve made an effort to ensure the simulations are configurable through the macros and the configuration files associated with the Python tools. If more configurability or features are desired, it would be pretty easy to add it, just let me know. The way the macros are set up this time around makes it very easy to add functionality. Where things start diverging is the batch workflow. Last year’s macros could do interactive sessions just fine, so there wasn’t anything to learn. This year is different. You will definitely need some cursory familiarity with bash scripts and the Unix terminal. A little Python exposure wouldn’t hurt either.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);">Also, DON'T REUSE SIMULATIONS. Make sure you ALWAYS start from a 0 yaw basesim. There are certain cases where the macros will explode if you run a yaw sim, and use that yaw environment as a starting point for your next simulation. It sucks, and it's probably not a horribly difficult fix, but it's incredibly low priority right now. Just stick with starting every new part revision from a PF20_X-X basesim.</span></p><p><strong>3.2 Accessing Scholar</strong></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);">Previously, the goto method of accessing scholar was to use the thinlinc client. Typically the web client over at <a class="external-link" href="http://desktop.scholar.rcac.purdue.edu" rel="nofollow"><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);">desktop.scholar.rcac.purdue.edu</span></a>. Doing this however brings in massive latency annoyances. It’s preferable to access the scholar terminal through your own local Unix terminal of choice. If you have a Mac or a Linux machine, simply open a terminal and enter in ssh <a class="external-link" href="mailto:username@scholar.rcac.purdue.edu" rel="nofollow"><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);">username@scholar.rcac.purdue.edu</span></a> (assuming you have a scholar account). If you have a Windows machine, it is up to you to set up a Unix terminal. My goto was to set up a Ubuntu WSL on Windows 10, before eventually caving in and dual booting Ubuntu proper. Setting up a WSL is however a much easier and less invasive process, and shouldn’t take more than a couple minutes. PuTTY should theoretically work as well. Once you ssh into scholar, you’ll have access to all the same terminal commands as you would with a terminal launched through the thinlinc client. Look into ssh-keygens to store ssh keys so you don’t have to enter in your password every time you ssh into scholar.</span></p><p><br/><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);">For file access, you could map the rcac drive to your computer exactly the same way you mapped your home purdue drive (details on how can be found on the rcac website), or you can use a SFTP client and use the ssh/SFTP protocol. I’ve had better luck with SFTP since it doesn’t require you to be on a Purdue network. For SFTP, use <a class="external-link" href="mailto:username@scholar.rcac.purdue.edu" rel="nofollow"><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);">username@scholar.rcac.purdue.edu</span></a>. Linux and (I’m guessing) Mac machines should support SFTP natively through the file explorer. Windows requires a separate program (your pick).</span></p><p><br/><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);">If you absolutely need to have a GUI, use the thinlinc web client. Don’t expect GUI performance to be useable however, and the latency can be anywhere between tolerable and absolutely unusable with the web client.</span></p><p><br/><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);">There are also plenty of apps for Android/iOS for Unix terminals and SFTP. So if you ever want to check up on a sim on the go, you can, and don’t have to open up thinlinc on a phone browser.</span></p><h4 id="TutorialsandWorkflow-3.3SettingUpGeometery"><strong><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);">3.3 Setting Up Geometery</span></strong></h4><p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);">NAMING CONVENTION IS IMPORTANT. It’s crucial that all your geometry follows a naming convention. The java code looks for RW, FW, UT, EC, NS, MOUNT, SW, FC, CFD in the part/surface name to determine what part it is. Every time the java code needs to decide what part a given geometry element is, it checks to see if the representation name of the element contains one of those capitalized codes. If you have a new NS, and name it NS_3-1 it’ll be fine. If you have a new RW, and name it n8509_w_lg, it won’t be fine.

This is probably the most powerful way to run a set of simulations, and is going to yield more control than using a tool to generate the batch files. Important commands to know are the export commands, the qsub command, and the runstar command.</span></li></ul><p><br/></p><ul><li><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);">To set an environment variable, use “export var = val”; For example, your batch script should include “export rrh = 1;” if you want to set your rear ride height to 1 inch above the baseline.</span></li></ul><p><br/></p><ul><li><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);">To reference a variable in a later command, use $VAR. So having $PODKEY in a command after you’ve already run export PODKEY=yourpodkey would replace substitute $PODKEY with your PODKEY</span></li></ul><p><br/></p><ul><li><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);">To run a star batch session, the command is - &quot;$STARLOC&quot; &quot;$SIMPATH/$FILENAME&quot; -batch &quot;$CP/$MACRO&quot; -machinefile $PBS_NODEFILE -cpubind -rsh ssh -np $PROCS -podkey $PODKEY -classpath &quot;$CP&quot; -power</span></li></ul><p><br/></p><ul><li><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);">Bash is a horrifically difficult language to work with though, but offers far more configurability than we’ll ever get out of an internally built tool to generate batch scripts.

The tool itself is still under active development, however two components of it have been built. There’s still more work to be done to make the tool smarter, easier to use, and more powerful. </span><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);">Right now there are two scripts. folderBuilder.py and csvBuilder.py. Both of them need to be run through python3, and likely will require you to install additional modules beyond what the Unix terminal on scholar already has. </span><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);">csvBuilder.py works by taking a spreadsheet input (you’ll have to manually edit the code to give it a file name for the spreadsheet), and uses the inputs in the spreadsheet to generate a single batch file than can be submitted to the job scheduler through a qsub command. Ensure there’s a column for every single flag that’s listed in the “flag list” google doc in the fsae aero folder. There is an example spreadsheet in the /python/ folder. It’s an older one, it might not have all the flags you need. Just go ahead and add new columns. </span><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);">folderBuilder.py works by creating a batch file that will handle submitting a job to the cluster, and children batch files that will handle macro execution for the simulations themselves. Currently folderBuilder can generate one batch file for each sim, or one batch file for every sim. folderBuilder.py must be given locations for the folder where the sim files are kept. folderBuilder.py will set environment variables for each simulation based on an inputted configuration file. Everyone should ideally have their own configuration file. Every entry in the flag list document must be in the configuration file. For formatting, look at some of the scripts already in the python folder. Folder builder automatically sets the newName flag.
