                    <p>This document will go over the recommended process to follow to design a monocoque chassis from the main roll hoop to the front bulkhead. The process will be split into the following sections: the important reference geometry, the templates and Percy, the roll hoops, the front bulkhead support surface, and the side impact structure surface. I will focus more on the reason why you want to do things a certain way rather than tell you how to CAD surfaces.</p><p> </p><p>I-                   Important Reference Geometry</p><p>The Chassis geometry is very dependent on the placement of the suspension points because the designed model needs to accommodate the suspension points such that the control arms, rockers, etc. can be placed appropriately on the monocoque. The same is true for a spaceframe. Figure 1, below, is an isometric view of the suspension point part. Since the monocoque only applies from the main roll hoop forwards, the front suspension points, shown on the right side of Figure 1, is of main interest. However, the location of the rear suspension points also gives an initial idea of how long your monocoque should be.</p><p><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper image-center-wrapper confluence-embedded-manual-size"><img class="confluence-embedded-image image-center" draggable="false" height="250" src="attachments/143759789/143759846.png" data-image-src="attachments/143759789/143759846.png" data-unresolved-comment-count="0" data-linked-resource-id="143759846" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="attachment" data-linked-resource-default-alias="image2020-4-18_17-8-55.png" data-base-url="https://wiki.itap.purdue.edu" data-linked-resource-content-type="image/png" data-linked-resource-container-id="143759789" data-linked-resource-container-version="3" alt=""></span></p><p align="center">Figure 1. Suspension Point Part</p><p>Given the suspension points, you may now start adding the static planes in your assembly. These planes are shown in Figure 2, below, the horizontal plane represents the ground, and the vertical plane is the midplane of the assembly. These planes are useful because on the one hand you know that you can’t have any geometry below the ground plane, thus partially constraining the z-axis, and on the other hand, if your geometry is symmetric, then you can use the midplane to mirror your geometry to save time.</p><p><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper image-center-wrapper confluence-embedded-manual-size"><img class="confluence-embedded-image image-center" draggable="false" height="250" src="attachments/143759789/143759847.png" data-image-src="attachments/143759789/143759847.png" data-unresolved-comment-count="0" data-linked-resource-id="143759847" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="attachment" data-linked-resource-default-alias="image2020-4-18_17-9-15.png" data-base-url="https://wiki.itap.purdue.edu" data-linked-resource-content-type="image/png" data-linked-resource-container-id="143759789" data-linked-resource-container-version="3" alt=""></span></p><p align="center">Figure 2. Static Planes in Chassis Assembly</p><p>Once the static planes are set, you may start adding the mobile reference geometry. Mobile geometry refers to planes, points, or lines where it is possible to modify their positioning in the Chassis assembly. Figure 3, below, shows a side view of the most important mobile planes that you may want to integrate in your assembly before designing your model. Looking at the bottom of Figure 3, the second horizontal plane represents the minimum allowable ground clearance that your model should always have. This height is usually given by the aerodynamics team because their undertray will be mounted underneath the chassis. As a result, if your model goes below that plane, it will mean that the car will be in direct contact with the ground, which is not ideal for obvious reasons.</p><p><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper image-center-wrapper confluence-embedded-manual-size"><img class="confluence-embedded-image image-center" draggable="false" height="250" src="attachments/143759789/143759848.png" data-image-src="attachments/143759789/143759848.png" data-unresolved-comment-count="0" data-linked-resource-id="143759848" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="attachment" data-linked-resource-default-alias="image2020-4-18_17-9-32.png" data-base-url="https://wiki.itap.purdue.edu" data-linked-resource-content-type="image/png" data-linked-resource-container-id="143759789" data-linked-resource-container-version="3" alt=""></span></p><p align="center">Figure 3. Mobile Planes and Static Planes in Chassis Assembly</p><p>The tilted plane represents the plane for the main roll hoop, the plane to the right of the main roll hoop plane is the front roll hoop plane, and the right most plane is the front bulkhead plane. These three planes give you an idea of how long your monocoque will be and act like borders that represent the different sections of the chassis. For example, the side impact structure section is within the main roll hoop and front roll hoop planes, and the front bulkhead supports section is in between the front roll hoop and front bulkhead planes. The dotted line that goes from the top of the main roll hoop plane to the top of the front roll hoop plane represents the height at which the body of your driver should not surpass. At all times, the driver should be at least 2 inches below the line. Finally, the front suspension points control arms, shown on the right of Figure 3, are also useful to make sure that your model is defined such that they can easily be attached via tabs and inserts.</p><p>II-                   The Templates and Percy</p><p>Once the reference planes are put into the assembly, the next step consists in adding the templates used to constrain the width of the monocoque, and the driver template used by SAE to make sure that a chassis complies to rules (2020 Rules F.5.5.4). Figure 4, below, shows the driver model template (Percy), which is used to constrain the height of the main and front roll hoops, as well as the initial distance of the bulkhead plane from the front roll hoop plane.</p><p><br/></p><p><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper image-center-wrapper confluence-embedded-manual-size"><img class="confluence-embedded-image image-center" draggable="false" height="250" src="attachments/143759789/143759849.png" data-image-src="attachments/143759789/143759849.png" data-unresolved-comment-count="0" data-linked-resource-id="143759849" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="attachment" data-linked-resource-default-alias="image2020-4-18_17-9-55.png" data-base-url="https://wiki.itap.purdue.edu" data-linked-resource-content-type="image/png" data-linked-resource-container-id="143759789" data-linked-resource-container-version="3" alt=""></span></p><p align="center">Figure 4. The Percy driver model</p><p>Additionally, to the driver model, SAE requires that the chassis can fit two specific templates in the cockpit and nose sections (2020 Rules T.1.1 &amp; T.1.2). Figure 5, below, represents the cockpit and internal cross section templates that are used to make sure that your model is wide enough. These two templates are a good starting point to design the outer surface of the chassis because if your chassis is not able to fit these templates, then SAE will not let you run your car with that chassis.</p><p><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper image-center-wrapper confluence-embedded-manual-size"><img class="confluence-embedded-image image-center" draggable="false" height="201" src="attachments/143759789/143759850.png" data-image-src="attachments/143759789/143759850.png" data-unresolved-comment-count="0" data-linked-resource-id="143759850" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="attachment" data-linked-resource-default-alias="image2020-4-18_17-10-26.png" data-base-url="https://wiki.itap.purdue.edu" data-linked-resource-content-type="image/png" data-linked-resource-container-id="143759789" data-linked-resource-container-version="3" alt=""></span></p><p style="text-align: center;">Figure 5. The Internal Cross Section template (left) and Cockpit template (right)</p><p>Following the addition of the templates, and the reference geometry, it is time to move onto the design of the main and front roll hoops.</p><p>III-                   The Roll Hoops</p><p>Unlike for a spaceframe, the roll hoops in a monocoque will generally be mechanically attached using tabs and inserts inside the tub of the monocoque (2020 Rules F.7.9). The roll hoops need to travel all around the tub. When designing the roll hoops, you should pay special attention to the shape given to the tubes because they will directly impact the surface geometry of the monocoque. Moreover, check the allowable bends that the tubes can have because it is not possible to bend the tubes to every radius. Figure 6, below, shows the integration of the roll hoops into the reference geometry and template assembly. The main roll hoop should be wide enough such that the cockpit template does not conflict with the roll hoop geometry. In the same way, the front roll hoop should be wider and taller than the nose template. To begin the roll hoop design consider making the front roll hoop just slightly bigger than the nose template, and the main roll hoop slightly wider than the top of the cockpit template, as shown in Figure 6.</p><p><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper image-center-wrapper confluence-embedded-manual-size"><img class="confluence-embedded-image image-center" draggable="false" height="250" src="attachments/143759789/143759851.png" data-image-src="attachments/143759789/143759851.png" data-unresolved-comment-count="0" data-linked-resource-id="143759851" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="attachment" data-linked-resource-default-alias="image2020-4-18_17-12-24.png" data-base-url="https://wiki.itap.purdue.edu" data-linked-resource-content-type="image/png" data-linked-resource-container-id="143759789" data-linked-resource-container-version="3" alt=""></span></p><p align="center">Figure 6. Design of the Main and Front Roll Hoops</p><p>IV-                   The Monocoque Surface</p><p>Once you have an initial design for the roll hoops and the reference planes are all placed in a good position, you may start designing the front tub of the monocoque. A monocoque usually also includes the rear of the chassis, however, it is easier to transition to a hybrid steel frame and front monocoque than a full monocoque in one step. When designing the monocoque, you should always remember that its main purpose is to reduce the weight of the chassis whilst keeping the same stiffness as a steel frame. As a result, you should try to optimize the geometry such that the monocoque has the smallest possible surface area.</p><p>            The section that is easiest to start with is the front bulkhead supports area of the tub. Since the design of a chassis is an iterative process and you will change the geometry multiple times, a good start is to make the front bulkhead section mimic the front template shown in Figure 6, above. Since that template represents the minimum width that your tub should have in the front bulkhead section, it makes no sense to have a nose width that is smaller than the template. In the same way, for an initial model, it makes no sense in having a nose width that is much greater than the nose template. Furthermore, since the nose template does not go all the way to the front bulkhead (2020 Rules T.1.2), you may want to optimize the geometry by decreasing the width of the front bulkhead support section as you reach the front bulkhead, as shown in Figure 7 below. Not only is it a good way to reduce the overall weight of the chassis, but it may be beneficial to the aerodynamic performance of the car (check with the present aerodynamics team to make sure it still holds). Moreover, notice how the front roll hoop of the tub in Figure 7 is tucked well inside the tub. It is important to have some overhang for the front roll hoop because on the one hand it helps to mechanically attach the front roll hoop, and on the other hand having the front roll hoop inside the tub would give more stiffness to the front bulkhead support zone rather than having the roll hoop stick out of the section. Finally, it is recommended to have cutouts in your monocoque to have easy access to your pedal box or to be able to remove the anti-intrusion plate. In Figures 8 and 9, both cutouts are shown for visual aid. Pay attention to how big the top cutout is for the pedal box because when you validate your monocoque in SES, you need to make sure the front bulkhead supports section passes rules using the cross section with the smallest cross sectional area. As a result, deciding the size of the cutout will directly impact the layup schedule for the front bulkhead supports. You just need to make it wide and long enough to that two hands can fit into it and make simple changes to the pedal box (pedal box position usually).</p><p><br/> Moving onto the side impact structure of the tub, before you look at Figure 7 and blindly copy the surface geometry, lets think about why the section was modelled as it was in Figure 7. Thinking back to the main purpose of a monocoque (weight savings), the first thing that should come to mind is optimizing your surface area. You may ask: why not have the front roll hoop and main roll hoop on the same plane and simply have a flat floor? This question was answered by the fact that the height of the front roll hoop matters a lot for the drivability of the car as it controls the position of the steering wheel. It was mentioned that if the front roll hoop is too low, then it becomes very difficult to steer the car. As a result, the best way to keep the front roll hoop at a reasonable height while optimizing the surface area of the monocoque would be to generate a nose lift between the side impact structure and the front bulkhead supports region. In Figure 7, if a flat surface was maintained, then the surface area of the model would increase by 8.41% compared to the original model. Furthermore, having a nose lift was beneficial to the aerodynamics team, to find the ideal nose lift height please refer to the “integration with other sub systems” document and ask the aerodynamics team directly. If your nose lift is too high, then it negatively impacts the aerodynamics of the car.</p><p><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper image-center-wrapper confluence-embedded-manual-size"><img class="confluence-embedded-image image-center" draggable="false" height="192" src="attachments/143759789/143759852.png" data-image-src="attachments/143759789/143759852.png" data-unresolved-comment-count="0" data-linked-resource-id="143759852" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="attachment" data-linked-resource-default-alias="image2020-4-18_17-12-53.png" data-base-url="https://wiki.itap.purdue.edu" data-linked-resource-content-type="image/png" data-linked-resource-container-id="143759789" data-linked-resource-container-version="3" alt=""></span></p><p align="center">Figure 7. Side view of the Monocoque Tub</p><p style="text-align: left;" align="center">Now that the transition between the front bulkhead supports to the side impact structure has been discussed, what are some good tips when it comes to modelling the cockpit of the side impact structure zone? Figures 8 and 9, below are good representations of the structure of the side impact area. Looking back at the cockpit template in Figure 5, you notice that the template’s width changes along its length. Therefore, it makes sense to create a surface around the template that changes in width as you go from the front of the side impact structure to the back. Figure 8 shows the expansion of the width of the side impact structure such that the surface area is optimized. The width of the back of the side impact structure was not shortened because such a sudden change in width would have proven hard to manufacture and it would be hard to integrate the rear frame of the chassis. Therefore, it was decided to leave a flat surface for the integration of the main roll hoop to the monocoque to facilitate the attachment of the roll hoop to the rear frame:</p><p style="text-align: left;" align="center"><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper image-center-wrapper confluence-embedded-manual-size"><img class="confluence-embedded-image image-center" draggable="false" height="229" src="attachments/143759789/143759853.png" data-image-src="attachments/143759789/143759853.png" data-unresolved-comment-count="0" data-linked-resource-id="143759853" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="attachment" data-linked-resource-default-alias="image2020-4-18_17-13-41.png" data-base-url="https://wiki.itap.purdue.edu" data-linked-resource-content-type="image/png" data-linked-resource-container-id="143759789" data-linked-resource-container-version="3" alt=""></span></p><p style="text-align: center;" align="center">Figure 8.

Front View of the Monocoque Tub</p><p>Additionally, it was discussed where to place the main roll hoop in the tub. At first, the main roll hoop was placed outside the tub because it seemed that the mechanical attachment of the tube would be possible, and it would offer the least obstacles for the assembly of the rear sub frame. However, placing the main roll hoop outside of the tub would add a lot of stress to the individual tabs that would hold the entire subframe, and the tabs would also need to be very long (2020 Rules F.7.7 &amp; F.7.9). Since tabs and inserts need to have a certain clearance from sharp edges, the sharp edge here being the end of the monocoque tub, it seemed more reasonable to have the main roll hoop within the tub such that the clearance was met and that the tabs and inserts were not ridiculously large. It is also foreseen that the main roll hoop, similarly to the front roll hoop, will provide additional stiffness to the monocoque under torsional loading if it is mounted inside the monocoque.</p>
