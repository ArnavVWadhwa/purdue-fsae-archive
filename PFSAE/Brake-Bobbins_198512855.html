                    <p>The process is the exact same for the front and rears, the only difference being the length of the bobbin</p><h2 id="BrakeBobbins-StockPrep"><u><strong>Stock Prep</strong></u></h2><p>For these, tubular steel of either etd-150 or 4130 works best, preferably already at the size of 0.5 in. Generally, also make sure it's short enough to fit in a lathe. </p><h2 id="BrakeBobbins-HighLevelSteps(Alldoneonmanuallathe)"><u><strong>High Level Steps (All done on manual lathe)</strong></u></h2><p><strong>Securing Stock</strong></p><p>It's best if there's only about two inches of stock sticking out from the lathe chuck, as this decreases the likelihood of extra play during all ops. </p><p><strong>Center drilling</strong></p><p>Use drill chuck and set the speed of the mill at about 800 rpm. Use lathe 4 if possible because it has coolant; if unavailable, use lubricant found near mills</p><p>Don't have to worry about drilling to a certain depth, which is nice. Just remember to not drill too deep into stock, as it could cause unwanted deflection</p><p><strong>Outer radius turning</strong></p><p>Set speed back to about 600 rpm</p><p>Should be done in passes of about 0.04 to 0.05 in per pass, EXCEPT the second to and final pass</p><p>On the penultimate pass, turn it down so there's about 0.01 in left, then go from there. This helps the precision of the tool and gets you a cleaner finish</p><p><strong>Notch Turning</strong></p><p>There's a specific tool in the cabinet near the sign in desk, ask anyone in the shop for a notch tool and they'll help</p><p>This step is a bit tricky to line up, but the basic gist of it goes like this:</p><ol><li>Measure the thickness of the tool using a caliper</li><li>Use a scrap corner of paper to place the tool against the end of the stock, just close enough to where the paper doesn't fall when you let go, but you can still move it. Mark down the value of Z in this position too</li><li>Check the drawing to see how far from the end of the part the notch needs to be</li><li>Take the value of Z, subtract the thickness of the paper (0.003 in), the thickness of the part, and the depth into the part. This is where the notch should be lined up</li></ol><p>Remember to use coolant or lubricant when making the notch</p><p><strong>Parting</strong></p><p>This is largely the same as turning the notch, use the same alignment process as the notch, but instead use the thickness of the parting tool and the full length of the part as values there</p><p>Turn it down while keeping a small allen wrench in the hole to catch it when it falls off</p><p>There may be some excess scrap on the parted end, either deburr or sand it off</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p>
