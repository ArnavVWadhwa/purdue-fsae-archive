                    <p><br/></p><p>After losing a 2019 WR450F engine on the dyno there were some lessons to be learned while tuning on the dyno.</p><p><br/></p><p>What happened: The transmission seized while running at steady 5000rpm in 5th gear at 50% throttle with a reasonable load on the engine. This failure was very strange because we were not making any changes at the moment the engine seized. The output shaft from the engine immediately stopped spinning and the dyno lurched from the abrupt stop and the rpm of the engine quickly spiked and then came to a stop. After disassembling the engine we found that the dogs that transfer the torque for 5th gear had sheared and the shift fork that moved that gear was mangled. The engine rpm spiked because when the dogs sheared it lodged the transmission stopped and the crank became disconnected from the transmission so it free spun, increasing the rpm. Looking inside the engine, the damage could be seen but there wasn't a smoking gun. I decided to get an oil sample to see if we could learn anything, specifically to see if there was fuel in the oil because that was a reason that we lost an R6 on the dyno during the previous season. The oil did not seem to have oil in it when we drained it, but it was still worth getting tested. </p><p><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper confluence-embedded-manual-size"><img class="confluence-embedded-image" draggable="false" height="250" src="attachments/196644986/200378083.jpg" data-image-src="attachments/196644986/200378083.jpg" data-unresolved-comment-count="0" data-linked-resource-id="200378083" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="attachment" data-linked-resource-default-alias="IMG_7632.jpg" data-base-url="https://wiki.itap.purdue.edu" data-linked-resource-content-type="image/jpeg" data-linked-resource-container-id="196644986" data-linked-resource-container-version="7" alt=""></span><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper confluence-embedded-manual-size"><img class="confluence-embedded-image" draggable="false" height="250" src="attachments/196644986/200378081.jpg" data-image-src="attachments/196644986/200378081.jpg" data-unresolved-comment-count="0" data-linked-resource-id="200378081" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="attachment" data-linked-resource-default-alias="IMG_7637.jpg" data-base-url="https://wiki.itap.purdue.edu" data-linked-resource-content-type="image/jpeg" data-linked-resource-container-id="196644986" data-linked-resource-container-version="7" alt=""></span><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper confluence-embedded-manual-size"><img class="confluence-embedded-image" draggable="false" height="250" src="attachments/196644986/200378080.jpg" data-image-src="attachments/196644986/200378080.jpg" data-unresolved-comment-count="0" data-linked-resource-id="200378080" data-linked-resource-version="2" data-linked-resource-type="attachment" data-linked-resource-default-alias="IMG_7638.jpg" data-base-url="https://wiki.itap.purdue.edu" data-linked-resource-content-type="image/jpeg" data-linked-resource-container-id="196644986" data-linked-resource-container-version="7" alt=""></span></p><p><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper confluence-embedded-manual-size"><img class="confluence-embedded-image" draggable="false" height="250" src="attachments/196644986/200378084.jpg" data-image-src="attachments/196644986/200378084.jpg" data-unresolved-comment-count="0" data-linked-resource-id="200378084" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="attachment" data-linked-resource-default-alias="IMG_7771.jpg" data-base-url="https://wiki.itap.purdue.edu" data-linked-resource-content-type="image/jpeg" data-linked-resource-container-id="196644986" data-linked-resource-container-version="7" alt=""></span></p><p><br/></p><p><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper"><a class="confluence-embedded-file" href="/download/attachments/196644986/MONDAY-211029.pdf?version=1&amp;modificationDate=1637367089000&amp;api=v2" data-nice-type="PDF Document" data-file-src="/download/attachments/196644986/MONDAY-211029.pdf?version=1&amp;modificationDate=1637367089000&amp;api=v2" data-linked-resource-id="196644988" data-linked-resource-type="attachment" data-linked-resource-container-id="196644986" data-linked-resource-default-alias="MONDAY-211029.pdf" data-mime-type="application/pdf" data-has-thumbnail="true" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-can-edit="true" aria-label="MONDAY-211029.pdf" draggable="false"><img src="rest/documentConversion/latest/conversion/thumbnail/196644988/1" height="250" alt="" draggable="false"/></a><span class="companion-edit-button-placeholder edit-button-overlay" data-linked-resource-container-id="196644986" data-linked-resource-id="196644988" data-template-name="companionEditIcon" data-source-location="embedded-attachment"></span></span></p><p>The oil sample report is attached above, in the report you can see that 4.3% of the oil sample is fuel, which is above blackstone's 2.0% recommended limit. The original oil was new that morning and probably had less than 2 hours of run time on it. It was amsoil 10W-30 motorcycle oil. Upon post inspection yamaha recommends 10W-40, 10W-50, 15W-40, 20W-40, or 20W-50 JASO standard MA. </p><p>After talking with other teams that run WR450's they say they have run 10W-30 weight oil without issue, however I would not recommend it after losing an engine. Because there was fuel in the oil, the oil was more like a 0W-20 weight oil, which means the oil was much thinner and was most likely not lubricating like it should have and cause the gear to heat up and fail. </p><p><br/></p><p>Another strange thing is the 5th gear in the 2021 WR450F compared to the 2019 WR450F is a different part number, while the other transmission gears and shafts are the same part numbers. I do not know what changes were made to 5th gear, however it does make me more confident in running the 2021 WR450F.</p><p><br/></p><h2 id="WR450FLessonsLearned-Sowhywastherefuelintheoil?">So why was there fuel in the oil?</h2><p>We were tuning the VE table with an injector that was too large and operating in the non-linear region, so we believe it was not supplying the amount of fuel we thought it was (probably more). Our VE values did also seem too high for the region that we were tuning. Which could be pointed back to the injector operating in the non-linear region.</p><p>So going forward, use a properly sized injector.</p><p>And when tuning VE for the first time, change your oil often. The WR450F uses very little oil and oil is cheap, engines are expensive. We will start off by probably changing the oil after every two VE columns to start. Once VE is figured out, we should be able to change the oil less, but while on the dyno we will be changing it before every session to be careful. </p><p>Once we are running the car, we will take oil samples after testing to check for fuel in the oil and trying to push out the oil change interval, but again, oil is cheap, engines are expensive.</p>
