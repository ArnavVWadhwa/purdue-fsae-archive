                    <h1 id="ChainStretchChecker-Problem">Problem</h1><p>Our drivetrain uses a chain to gear down the motorcycle engine final drive into a usable / optimal torque range that can move the car. There is a break in period for the chain which the chain will stretch. After the chain stretches, it is now in a usable range in which the stretch slows down and we do not need to tension the chain any longer. After several more hours of testing time the chain will stretch very slowly until it is no longer in a usable range anymore. If the chain exceeds this point, it will no longer wrap around the sprockets the same and it will break teeth on the sprocket from the misalignment.  </p><p>We need a way to measure chain stretch so we can estimate the life of our chain before it needs replacement. </p><p>The team uses &quot;520 Chain&quot; which is a type of chain commonly used in motorcycle applications. </p><p>Look up the specifications and make gauges that can show us which stage the chain is in: new, usable, unusable. We are looking for a go/no-go gauge, this would be a good thing the research to understand how they work.</p><p>Also make a carrying case for these gauges as they will be used for the next several years.</p><p><br/></p><p>Chain stretch was a serious problem when running PF20 at competition. We had tested the car for many hours prior to the 2021 FSAE Michigan Competition that the chain was close to exceeding the stretch limit. When doing some final checks at the practice field before the dynamic events, we started to hear drivetrain noise. This noise ended up being broken teeth on the aluminum final drive sprocket. Because we did not have the appropriate time to &quot;break in&quot; a new chain to the usable range, we ran the acceleration events and skidpad events on the sprocket with missing teeth. During lunch, we swapped the sprocket and chain for spares and went to the practice field to stretch the chain as much as we could. We competed in the auto-x and endurance events with a semi-stretched chain and ended up being fine. </p><p>In order to prevent this from happening again we want to make gauges to estimate how much life we might have on the chain. </p><p><br/></p><p>Things to consider</p><ul style="list-style-type: square;"><li>Chain stretch checkers exist already, but they only let you know when your chain is not longer usable<ul style="list-style-type: square;"><li>We want to be able to check if something is a new, ready to be used, or over stretched chain</li></ul></li><li>How are you going to manufacture this, what material will it be from?</li></ul><p><br/></p>
