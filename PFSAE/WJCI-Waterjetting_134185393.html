                    <p>#define BIDC &quot;Bechtel Innovation Design Center&quot;<br/>#define WJCI &quot;Waterjet Cutting of Indiana&quot;</p><p>Our two options for waterjetting parts are the BIDC and WJCI. Like many things in life, there are pros and cons of each: the BIDC has the advantage of being a faculty-managed, community makerspace that is stocked with &quot;top&quot;-of-the-line machines, staffed by homegrown Boilers, and located a scant 5 minutes from the main campus; at WJCI, the machines will be properly operated. As a result, the bulk of our flat parts is typically cut at WJCI, while the BIDC is reserved for either parts for individual projects or panic cuts when something goes wrong. I'm going to go over waterjetting at WJCI, while someone else can probably go over waterjetting at the BIDC and edit this sentence later or something.</p><h2 id="WJCIWaterjetting-WaterjetCuttingofIndiana">Waterjet Cutting of Indiana</h2><h3 id="WJCIWaterjetting-ContactInfo">Contact Info</h3><p>See page: <a href="https://wiki.itap.purdue.edu/display/PFSAE/WJCI+Contact+Info" rel="nofollow">WJCI Contact Info - Purdue Formula SAE - Confluence</a></p><p>(team lead restricted)</p><h3 id="WJCIWaterjetting-Protocol">Protocol</h3><h4 id="WJCIWaterjetting-FirstContact">First Contact</h4><p>Text Mike Trapp as soon as possible with a date range in mind. It's not uncommon for Mike to take his time getting back to you, and he may be busy during the specified date range. It took 10 days for him to get back to me, for reference. He'll eventually get back to you and ask that you to call him as it gets closer to the time frame in order to specify an exact date and time. The building closes at 5PM, so you'll most likely be scheduled for then. After a date is locked down, fill out the sponsorship form on the website (&quot;Education and Sponsorship&quot; → bottom of page).</p><h4 id="WJCIWaterjetting-Preparation">Preparation</h4><p>You'll need the following:</p><ul><li>*.dxf and *.ord files made and loaded on onto <strong>multiple</strong> separate flash drives (just copy all of them onto every drive). Mike will not make them for us and hates it when <s>the FIRST teams</s> we mess it up</li><li>the USB drives. Don't drive halfway there before remembering them</li><li>material to cut, Mike is okay with us shipping Alro orders to his facility</li><li>people to man the machines. need 1 per machine, though Mike sometimes watches one himself if there aren't enough people.</li><li>PPE: safety glasses, ear plugs, gloves <s>(optional)</s> to pick up material. *gloves are not as optional as I thought they were</li><li>clothes that you are okay with being covered in garnet dust.</li><li>Last year's team shirt if it's the first jetting session of the year</li><li>Six pack of beer. <s>Corona is safe choice</s>, (apparently he's no longer a corona guy... zombie dust or stella artois are the new go tos, makers mark if we really screw up) has accepted Purdue beer (Boiler series by People's Brewing Company) in the past. That being said, it's probably alright to skip this if everyone going is &lt;21 years of age</li></ul><h4 id="WJCIWaterjetting-Additionalnotesonfilesandgeneralpreparation">Additional notes on files and general preparation</h4><ul style="list-style-type: square;"><li>Start with a empty flash drive, only include .dxf and .ord files on the drive. Mike doesn't like other files on there</li><li>Use each tab as the lead in and lead out, do not have a tab and a lead in/out as this increases number of pierces and increases cut time significantly</li><li>Each (small) tab should only have one pierce (one tab as the lead in/out), exception being larger parts that you may want to consider using two tabs diagonal to each other to keep it down while cutting</li><li>Don't need to cut outer edge of sized sheets (jig plates)</li><li>If cutting many of the same parts (lots of small tabs) arrange them so that leads are in line. Prioritize time efficiency over material efficiency</li><li>Cutting limited by machine availability, but also by number of people to watch the machines, bring 3-4 people</li><li>Bring a paint pen / sharpie</li><li>Use marker to indicate orientation for confusing parts (jig plates)</li><li>For parts with sharp corners (tabs with conic section cutouts), round the end off so that it terminates in an arc w/ 0.010&quot; radii</li><li>Always path parts such that the interior features (bolt holes) are cut before cutting exterior shape of part, even if its tabbed, part could move resulting in poor accuracy</li><li>Stop the tool path at the last part- don't want it to increase chance of snapping the tip off</li><li>Have second person to check over drawings</li><li>There's a view that you can pull up that shows you the exact path taken. Be sure to check to make sure that it's correct (outside line for shape, inside line for holes).</li><li>Check to make sure that your cut fits on the material you are cutting out of.</li><li>Bring someone who knows how to make the drawings in case you need to make edits.</li></ul><h4 id="WJCIWaterjetting-Cutting">Cutting</h4><p>Mike himself handles setting up the machines; everyone else more or less just stares at the jet for hours and makes sure that either 1) the cut-outs don't block jet, 2) nothing drops, or 3) the head doesn't ram into anything. In case you are in doubt of priority, not getting your fingers jetted off comes first, preventing the machine from breaking comes second, and saving any parts comes last. You can more or less just follow Mike's lead, but you more or less assign one USB and one person per machine and then jet away.</p><h4 id="WJCIWaterjetting-PartAccuracy">Part Accuracy</h4><p>Expect water jetted parts from WJCI to be fairly accurate. For interior holes expect the hole size to be accurate +- 1 thousandth on the large size and slightly smaller on the back due to kerf. Holes that are a critical diameter should be designed to size and expect to drill out and deburr to the exact size you need when you get the parts back. </p><h4 id="WJCIWaterjetting-Food">Food</h4><p>I'd like to also point out that there is a convenient Chic-Fil-A (Avon) close by WJCI. Current record is 9 min from there to WJCI (Tam, Xia, Olson: 2019). Edit: there's a lot of stuff there, just look around.</p>
